Create a script to calculate the distance to and rotation of the floor under an entity.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create FloorDetector**:

 - Create script Code/Movement/**[FloorDetector](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/blob/GroundDectionDetectFloors/Assets/Code/Movement/FloorDetector.cs)**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Collider2D))]
public class FloorDetector : MonoBehaviour
{
  public Bounds feetBounds
  {
    get
    {
      return myCollider.bounds;
    }
  }

  public bool isTouchingFloor
  {
    get; private set;
  }

  public float? distanceToFloor
  {
    get; private set;
  }

  public Vector2? floorUp
  {
    get; private set;
  }

  public Quaternion? floorRotation
  {
    get; private set;
  }

  [SerializeField]
  ContactFilter2D floorFilter;

  static readonly Collider2D[] tempColliderList = new Collider2D[3];

  static readonly RaycastHit2D[] tempHitList = new RaycastHit2D[1];

  Collider2D myCollider;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    myCollider = GetComponent<Collider2D>();
  }

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    Collider2D floorWeAreStandingOn = DetectTheFloorWeAreStandingOn();
    isTouchingFloor = floorWeAreStandingOn != null;

    if(floorWeAreStandingOn != null)
    { 
      CalculateFloorRotation(floorWeAreStandingOn);
      distanceToFloor = 0;
    }
    else
    { 
      floorUp = null;
      floorRotation = null;
      RaycastHit2D? floorUnderUs = DetectFloorUnderUs();
      if(floorUnderUs != null)
      {
        distanceToFloor = floorUnderUs.Value.distance;
      }
      else
      {
        distanceToFloor = null;
      }
    }
  }

  void CalculateFloorRotation(
    Collider2D floorWeAreStandingOn)
  {
    floorUp = floorWeAreStandingOn.transform.up;
    floorRotation = floorWeAreStandingOn.transform.rotation;
    if(Vector2.Dot(Vector2.up, floorUp.Value) < 0)
    {
      floorUp = -floorUp;
      floorRotation *= Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 180);
    }
  }

  RaycastHit2D? DetectFloorUnderUs()
  {
    if(Physics2D.Raycast(
      transform.position,
      Vector2.down,
      floorFilter,
      tempHitList) > 0)
    {
      return tempHitList[0];
    }

    return null;
  }

  Collider2D DetectTheFloorWeAreStandingOn()
  {
    int foundColliderCount
      = Physics2D.OverlapCollider(
        myCollider, 
        floorFilter, 
        tempColliderList);

    for(int i = 0; i < foundColliderCount; i++)
    {
      Collider2D collider = tempColliderList[i];
      ColliderDistance2D distance = collider.Distance(myCollider);

      if(distance.distance >= -.1f
        && Vector2.Dot(Vector2.up, distance.normal) > 0)
      {
        return collider;
      }
    }

    return null;
  }
}
```

<br>**Configure entities**:

 - Add **FloorDetector** to:
   - The Character prefab.
   - The SpikeBall prefab.
   - The HoverGuy's Feet child GameObject.
 - For each of those FloorDetector components, update the Floor Filter:
     - Check Use Layer Mask
     - Layer Mask: Floor

Note that there is nothing to test until components leveraging this information is added.

<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

using clauses at the top of a file brings APIs into scope. Used for:

 - UnityEngine.Bounds
 - UnityEngine.BoxCollider2D
 - UnityEngine.Collider2D
 - UnityEngine.ColliderDistance2D
 - UnityEngine.ContactFilter2D
 - UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour
 - UnityEngine.Physics2D
 - UnityEngine.RaycastHit2D

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute which informs the editor that this script requires a collider component on the GameObject.

```csharp
[RequireComponent(typeof(Collider2D))]
```

We inherit from MonoBehaviour, which allows this script to be added as a component on a GameObject.

public is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
public class FloorDetector : MonoBehaviour
{
```

This is the collider Bounds for the collider FloorDetector is using.  This may be the entity collider itself, or a special feet collider.

Public so that other components may use this information, such as to know the Y position of the entity's feet.

```csharp
  public Bounds feetBounds
  {
    get
    {
      return myCollider.bounds;
    }
  }
```

This returns true if the entity is in contact with the floor under it.

Public so that other components may know if the entity is standing or in the air.

```csharp
  public bool isTouchingFloor
  {
    get; private set;
  }
```

This returns the distance, in meters, to the floor under the entity.  If the entity is standing, this will be 0.  

It's null if there is no floor found.

```csharp
  public float? distanceToFloor
  {
    get; private set;
  }
```

This returns the Transform up for the floor, or the normal.  This represents the direction perpendicular to the surface.

Public so that other components can use this information, such as to know if the platform is slanted.

```csharp
  public Vector2? floorUp
  {
    get; private set;
  }
```

This returns the rotation for the floor's GameObject.

Public so that other components can use this information, such as to rotate a standing entity.

```csharp
  public Quaternion? floorRotation
  {
    get; private set;
  }
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute that exposes a field in the Inspector, allowing you to configure it for the object.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
```

This defines which GameObject types should be considered floor.  Set in the Inspector.

```csharp
  ContactFilter2D floorFilter;
```

This is a list to use when calling OverlapCollider.  Here so that we can reuse the array each time, improving performance.

It is static readonly since we only need one, which can be shared across objects and the array itself will never change.

The length of this array is 3, allowing us to consider multiple floors when we are touching more than one.

```csharp
  static readonly Collider2D[] tempColliderList = new Collider2D[3];
```

This is a list to use when calling Raycast.  Here so that we can reuse the array each time, improving performance.

It is static readonly since we only need one, which can be shared across objects and the array itself will never change.

The length of this array is 1 because we only ever need to consider the first result.

```csharp
  static readonly RaycastHit2D[] tempHitList = new RaycastHit2D[1];
```

The collider on this GameObject.  Cached here for performance.

```csharp
  Collider2D myCollider;
```

Awake is a Unity method which is called once, when the GameObject is first added to the scene.

protected is optional here.  Used for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void Awake()
  {
```

Here we get a reference to the collider on this GameObject.  The bottom of this collider represents the Y position of the entity's feet.

```csharp
    myCollider = GetComponent<Collider2D>();
  }
```

FixedUpdate is a Unity method which is called every x ms of game time.

protected is optional here.  Used for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
```

Here we call a helper method, defined below, to get the collider for the floor we are standing on, if any.

```csharp
    Collider2D floorWeAreStandingOn = DetectTheFloorWeAreStandingOn();
```

If a collider was found, then set isTouchingFloor to true, else to false.

```csharp
    isTouchingFloor = floorWeAreStandingOn != null;
```

Check if we are standing on a floor.

```csharp
    if(floorWeAreStandingOn != null)
    {
```

We are standing on a floor, here we call a helper method defined below to calculate the rotation.

```csharp
      CalculateFloorRotation(floorWeAreStandingOn);
```

When standing, the distanceToFloor is assumed to be exactly 0.

```csharp
      distanceToFloor = 0;
    }
    else
    {
```

We are not standing on a floor.  These rotation variables are meant to represent the floor we are on, so when in the air these are cleared.

```csharp
      floorUp = null;
      floorRotation = null;
```

This uses a helper method defined below to detect the first floor under the entity.

```csharp
      RaycastHit2D? floorUnderUs = DetectFloorUnderUs();
```

Check if a floor was found.  

```csharp
      if(floorUnderUs != null)
      {
```

If we found a floor under the entity, store the distance which was calculated by Unity when raycasting.

```csharp
        distanceToFloor = floorUnderUs.Value.distance;
      }
      else
      {
```

If we were unable to find a floor under the entity, clear distanceToFloor.  This should never happen with the current level design.

```csharp
        distanceToFloor = null;
      }
    }
  }
```

This is a helper method to get rotation information about the floor we are standing on, represented by the collider provided.

```csharp
  void CalculateFloorRotation(
    Collider2D floorWeAreStandingOn)
  {
```

Here we store the floor's rotation information.

```csharp
    floorUp = floorWeAreStandingOn.transform.up;
    floorRotation = floorWeAreStandingOn.transform.rotation;
```

Here we use the dot product of the world's up direction and the floor's up direction to determine if the floor is facing upwards or if it is upside down.

```csharp
    if(Vector2.Dot(Vector2.up, floorUp.Value) < 0)
    {
```

The floor is upside down, so here we flip both the up direction and the rotation so that they represent the bottom of the floor (i.e. the side the entity is standing on) instead of the top.

To flip the up direction, we take the negative.

```csharp
      floorUp = -floorUp;
```

To flip the rotation, we multiply by (0, 0, 180).

```csharp 
      floorRotation *= Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 180);
    }
  }
```

This is a helper method to raycast, looking for a floor under the entity.

It returns information about the floor relative to this entity, if one was found.

```csharp
  RaycastHit2D? DetectFloorUnderUs()
  {
```

Here we check if a raycast from the entity's position pointing upwards finds a floor.

```csharp
    if(Physics2D.Raycast(
      transform.position,
      Vector2.down,
      floorFilter,
      tempHitList) > 0)
    {
```

A floor was found, return information about the floor relative to this entity.

```csharp
      return tempHitList[0];
    }
```

No floor was found.

```csharp
    return null;
  }
```

This is a helper method to detect a floor that we are standing on.

It returns collider for the floor found, if any.

```csharp
  Collider2D DetectTheFloorWeAreStandingOn()
  {
```

Here we check if this GameObject's collider is overlapping with any floors.

```csharp
    int foundColliderCount
      = Physics2D.OverlapCollider(
        myCollider, 
        floorFilter, 
        tempColliderList);
```

This loops over each of the colliders found.

Note that we use the count returned by the method above and not the size of the array results are stored in.  This is because the array may be larger than the number of results returned.

```csharp
    for(int i = 0; i < foundColliderCount; i++)
    {
      Collider2D collider = tempColliderList[i];
```

Here we ask Unity to calculate stats about the overlap between this entity and the floor.

```csharp
      ColliderDistance2D distance = collider.Distance(myCollider);
```

Check if the entity is above this floor.  Due to the one-way colliders used on Platforms, we may overlap a floor while jumping and that should not be included here.

The dot product of the world's up direction with the normal direction of the point of collision. 

 - Negative means the point of collision was on the bottom of the platform (e.g. maybe while jumping) 
 - Positive means the point of collision was on the top (i.e. a floor you are standing on).

```csharp
      if(distance.distance >= -.1f
        && Vector2.Dot(Vector2.up, distance.normal) > 0)
      {
```

The entity is standing on a floor, return its collider.

```csharp
        return collider;
      }
    }
```

The entity is not standing on a floor.

```csharp
    return null;
  }
}
```

<details><summary>What's a C# Nullable type / what's the question mark after 'float'?</summary>

Structs in C# must have a value (as opposed to classes which may have a value or be null).  Sometimes this is limiting and another piece of information is required.  

Nullable types in C# are a feature which allows you to add one more possible value to any struct, by adding a question mark after the type. For example:

```csharp
bool? trueFalseOrNull;
trueFalseOrNull = null;
trueFalseOrNull = true;
trueFalseOrNull = false;
```

Often nullable types are used to indicate an error state or that no valid information is available.  Without the nullable feature, you may have implemented the same using another variable to indicate the state - or by using a magic number.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's C# 'is' do and how's it differ from 'as'?</summary>

In C#, 'is' may be used to check if an object is compatible with a given type - i.e., if a cast to that type would be successful.  For example:

```csharp
Collider2D floorUnderUs;
...
if(floorUnderUs is BoxCollider2D) 
{
  BoxCollider2D boxCollider = (BoxCollider2D)floorUnderUs;
  ...
}
```

'as' is a similar feature where instead of returning true or false, it returns null or the casted value.  For example:

```csharp
Collider2D floorUnderUs;
...
BoxCollider2D boxCollider = floorUnderUs as BoxCollider2D;
if(boxCollider != null) 
{
  ...
}
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's Dot product do?</summary>

The Dot product is a fast operation which can be used to efficiently determine if two directions represented with Vectors are facing the same (or a similar) way.

In the visualization below, we are rotating two ugly arrows.  These arrows are pointing in a direction and we are using Vector2.Dot to compare those two directions.  The Dot product is shown as we rotate around.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XrjcWQm.gif" width=200px />

A few notables about Dot products:

 - '1' means the two directions are facing the same way.
 - '-1' means the two directions are facing opposite ways.
 - '0' means the two directions are perpendicular.
 - Numbers smoothly transition between these points, so .9 means that the two directions are nearly identical.
 - When two directions are not the same, the Dot product will not tell you which direction an object should rotate in order to make them align - it only informs you about how similar they are at the moment.  

For this visualization, we are calculating the Dot product like so:

```csharp
Vector2.Dot(gameObjectAToWatch.transform.up, gameObjectBToWatch.transform.up);
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>When do you use OverlapCollider vs Raycast vs Distance vs Trigger*?</summary>

Unity offers a number of APIs for getting information about objects around you.  They are optimized for different use cases, and often you could have accomplished the same mechanic using a different API.

Until now in this tutorial we have been using Trigger* events (e.g., OnTriggerEnter2D).  These events push information to your script to react to.  Sometimes, like here, it's easier to pull the information.

We are using 3 different APIs to pull information in this script:

 - OverlapCollider returns the colliders which are touching this entity's collider.
 - Raycast projects a line and returns colliders intersecting with it (in order, closest first).  There are other 'cast' calls to project different shapes when needed, e.g., BoxCast.
 - collider.Distance returns precise information about the collision between two specific colliders, such as the contact point or if they are not touching the distance between them.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why add the edge radius to bounds max when calculating the floor's position?</summary>

When edge radius is used on a BoxCollider, the collider bounds represents the inner square of the collider (the size before edge is consider).  So in order to get the correct position we must add the edge radius in as well.

<details><summary>Why not use a cooldown instead?</summary>

You may consider using a cooldown by time instead.  This would create a different play experience, and if the cooldown is short the player may be able to double jump (but not fly by spamming space).

You might also want both a cooldown and the floor detection.  Small changes to mechanics like this can change how the game feels while playing.

<br>**Test**:

 - Play and HoverGuys should start to collect on the right half of the screen as they prefer walking up hill over down.  
   - You could try changing the odds of traveling up hill to 1 to really confirm that it's working.
   - You could also reduce the time between reconsidering direction for testing, which will help to emphasize the impact of changing odds.
 - You can also pick them up in the Scene view while playing to test their behavior on other platforms.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

This defines the odds of going up hill (vs down).  You change the default value in the Inspector.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  float oddsOfGoingUpHill = .8f; 
```

This is a reference to the FloorDetector component on this GameObject.  Cached here for performance.

```csharp
  FloorDetector floorDetector; 
```

Here we get the FloorDetector component on this GameObject or one of its children.

```csharp
    floorDetector = GetComponentInChildren<FloorDetector>(); 
    float dot;
```

Check if we know the up direction for the floor the entity is standing on.  This value is null if the entity is in the air.

```csharp
    if(floorDetector.floorUp != null)
    {
```

Calculate the dot product for the floor's up direction and the world's right direction.

 - A positive dot product tells us that the floor is slanted so that it's going down and to the right.  
 - Negative means the floor is slanted down and to the left.
 - 0 means the floor is flat.

```csharp
      dot = Vector2.Dot(floorDetector.floorUp.Value, Vector2.right);
    }
    else
    {
```

If no floor was detected, set the dot to 0 so that the logic below behaves the same as if the floor under the entity was flat.

```csharp
      dot = 0;
    }
```

Check the dot product to know which direction is 'up hill'.

```csharp
    if(dot < 0)
    { 
```

Here we pick a random number between 0 and 1.  If that is below oddsOfGoingUpHill then we travel to the right (1) since the Platform below us is slanted down and to the left.

```csharp
      walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
        = UnityEngine.Random.value <= oddsOfGoingUpHill ? 1 : -1;
    }
    else if(dot > 0)
    { 
```

Here the Platform is slanted down and to the right, so up hill is -1 or left.

```csharp
      walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
        = UnityEngine.Random.value <= oddsOfGoingUpHill ? -1 : 1;
    }
```

Otherwise, the Platform under the entity is flat and we fall back to the original algorithm.

```csharp
    else
    { 
      ...
    }
```

</details>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Leveraging the FloorDetector, we give the HoverGuy better odds at walking up a platform vs walking down one.  Without this component the HoverGuy enemies may collect at the bottom of the level - this keeps them mostly moving forward/up while still using RNG to keep the player on their toes.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why take the Dot product with Vector2.right?</summary>

Dot product is used to determine if two directions are pointing the same way.  We compare the floor's up direction (or its normal) to the world right.  If the dot product is positive then we know that the platform is traveling down and to the right; if negative the platform is down and to the left; and it would be 0 if the platform were flat.

## 8.4) Rotate Entities

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/FloorUpHill.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/FloorRotate.zip)

Create a script to rotate an entity, aligning with the floor when touching one, otherwise rotating back to the default position.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create RotateToAlignWithFloor**:

 - Create script Code/Movement/**[RotateToAlignWithFloor](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/blob/FloorRotate/Assets/Code/Movement/RotateToAlignWithFloor.cs)**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class RotateToAlignWithFloor : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float lerpSpeedToFloor = 4f;

  [SerializeField]
  float lerpSpeedWhileInAir = .5f;

  FloorDetector floorDetector;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    floorDetector
      = GetComponentInChildren<FloorDetector>();
  }

  protected void Update()
  {
    Quaternion rotation;
    float speed;
    if(floorDetector.floorRotation != null)
    {
      rotation = floorDetector.floorRotation.Value;
      speed = lerpSpeedToFloor;
    }
    else
    {
      rotation = Quaternion.identity;
      speed = lerpSpeedWhileInAir;
    }

    transform.rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(
      transform.rotation,
      rotation,
      speed * Time.deltaTime);
  }
}
```

<br>**Configure entities**:

 - Add **RotateToAlignWithFloor** to the Character and HoverGuy prefabs.

<br>**Test**:

 - Move the Character and/or HoverGuys to various platforms and note their rotations.  Feet should be flat on the floor for slanted platforms and as they move from one to another the transitions should be smooth.

<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

using clauses at the top of a file brings APIs into scope. Used for:

 - UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour
 - UnityEngine.Quaternion
 - UnityEngine.SerializeFieldAttribute

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
```

We inherit from MonoBehaviour, which allows this script to be added as a component on a GameObject.

public is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
public class RotateToAlignWithFloor : MonoBehaviour
{
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute that exposes a field in the Inspector, allowing you to configure it for the object.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
```

This defines how quickly the entity should rotate to match the floor's rotation when standing on one.  You can change the default value in the Inspector.

```csharp
  float lerpSpeedToFloor = 4f;
```

This defines how quickly to rotate back to the entities original rotation while in the air.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  float lerpSpeedWhileInAir = .5f;
```

This is a reference to the FloorDetector component on this GameObject.  Cached here for performance.

```csharp
  FloorDetector floorDetector;
```

Awake is a Unity method which is called once, when the GameObject is first added to the scene.

protected is optional.  Used here for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void Awake()
  {
```

This gets a reference to the FloorDetector on this GameObject, or any of its children.

```csharp
    floorDetector
      = GetComponentInChildren<FloorDetector>();
  }
```

Update is a Unity method which is called every frame.

protected is optional.  Used here for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void Update()
  {
    Quaternion rotation;
    float speed;
    if(floorDetector.floorRotation != null)
    {
```

We are standing on a floor.  Set the target rotation to the floor's rotation and use the while standing lerp speed.

```csharp
      rotation = floorDetector.floorRotation.Value;
      speed = lerpSpeedToFloor;
    }
    else
    {
```

We are not standing on a floor.  Set the target rotation to Quaternion.identity, which is the default rotation and use the while in air speed.

```csharp
      rotation = Quaternion.identity;
      speed = lerpSpeedWhileInAir;
    }
```

Lerp the rotation from the current rotation to the target selected above, using the selected speed.  This results in movement where the further you are from the target, the faster it rotates.

```csharp
    transform.rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(
      transform.rotation,
      rotation,
      speed * Time.deltaTime);
  }
}
```

<details><summary>What's 'Lerp' and how's it compare to 'Slerp'?</summary>

Lerp, or **l**inear int**erp**olation, is a fancy term for a simple concept.  Draw a line between two points and travel a certain percent along that path, returning the position you end on.  For example:

```csharp
void Start()
{
  Vector2 a = new Vector2(1, 5);
  Vector2 b = new Vector2(4, 11);
  Vector2 c = Vector2.Lerp(a, b, 1/3f);
  print(c); // == (2, 7)
}
```

Slerp, or **s**pherical **l**inear int**erp**olation, is similar to lerp but the change in position accelerates at the beginning and decelerates towards the end.  It's called spherical because it is following the path of a half circle instead of a straight line.

Here you can see lerp vs slerp with only position X changing (the large balls), and change X and Y.  All are moving given the same % progress.  Notice how the movement for slerp at beginning and end are traveling at a different speed than the lerp - but the positions match exactly at the start, middle, and end.
