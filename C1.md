[YouTube]() | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/95fe96fefc55209471c2ce66db212cab7d4ff3b4.zip)

Start a 2D project and save the scene.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Download the software**:

 - Download [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/).
   - There is an optional workload for 'Game development with Unity' you should include.
 - Download [Unity 2017](https://unity3d.com/).
   - The free Personal edition has everything you need. 
   - You may be prompted to register / sign in.

<br>**Start a new project**:

 - Open Unity and create a project:
   - Select '2D' when creating a new project.
   - Enter a name/directory - the other options can be left at defaults.

<br>**Save the current scene**:

 - File -> 'Save Scenes'.
 - Save it as Assets/Scenes/**Level1**.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What are the limitations of Personal / Community editions?</summary>

Almost none.

Unity personal edition includes all the same engine features and performance that the pro edition does.  There are a couple minor differences such as with the personal edition you cannot set your own splash screen.  You can always upgrade later on.

VS Community edition is very similiar, the core features including everything we will need is include for free with the Community edition.

Both Unity and Visual Studio have a clause in the agreement which says you must upgrade when you / your company starts to make enough money.  Unity requires a paid upgrade once you make $100,000 per year, and Visual Studio once you make $1,000,000 per year.

</details>
<details><summary>Can I use Unity 5.* or Monodevelop instead?</summary>

No, we will be using the Timeline Editor which was not fully released until 2017.  Because of this you may get stuck on those sections, but the rest of the tutorial should work correctly.

Yes, you can use Monodevelop or Visual Studio, or any other IDE.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's 2D (vs 3D) impact in Unity?</summary>

Presenting the 2D vs 3D option when you create a new project suggests this is a significant choice.  It's not really... 2D just changes default settings on things like your camera.   Unity is a 3D engine, when creating 2D games your actually creating a 3D world where everything is very flat but the camera looks straight ahead and the only rotation in the world is around the z axis.  

[More on 2D vs 3D from Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/2Dor3D.html).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is a scene?</summary>

The Scene represents a collection of GameObjects and components (defined below) configured for a game level or menu screen.  For this tutorial we are starting by creating part of Level 1.  Level 2, the menu, and other UI screens will be saved as separate scenes.  You can switch scenes via the SceneManager, and will cover this later in the tutorial. 

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Can I name folders differently?</summary>

Absolutely, anywhere we mention a folder you can name it as you please with one exception.  "Editor" is a special folder name with Unity, anything under that directory is only run when testing in the Unity editor.

More about [special folder names from Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html).

<hr></details>


## 1.2) Import assets

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/95fe96fefc55209471c2ce66db212cab7d4ff3b4.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/661557efa406c565c0dcacc66b309a5746ed03d6.zip)

Import sprites and sounds into your project.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Download [all the assets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2bFgoFxZ-alc0NUejM5cFF5N28) for this tutorial.
 - Create directory Assets/**Art**:
   - In the Project window, right click in the Assets directory and select New Folder.
   - You can use F2 to rename.
 - Drag/drop all the assets (images and sounds) into the folder you just created.
   - If you have a zip file, you may need to unzip to a temp directory before drag/drop will work.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What is a sprite / sprite sheet?</summary>

A sprite is an image, used in 2D games and for UI.  They may represent an object, part of an object, or a frame of an entity's animation, etc.  

A sprite sheet is a single image file that contains multiple individual sprites.  The sheet may use these sprites to represent different frames for an animation or to hold a collection of various object types (as is the case here).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Who made the art for this tutorial?</summary>

We are using:
 - Kenney.nl [Platformer Characters 1](http://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-characters-1)
 - Kenney.nl's [Platformer Pack Redux](http://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack-redux)
 - Kenney.nl's [Jumper Pack](http://kenney.nl/assets/jumper-pack)
 - Kenney.nl's [Kenny Fonts](http://kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts)
 - Kenney.nl's [Digital Audio](http://kenney.nl/assets/digital-audio)
 - BoxCat Games' [Epic Song](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/BoxCat_Games/Nameless_the_Hackers_RPG_Soundtrack/BoxCat_Games_-_Nameless-_the_Hackers_RPG_Soundtrack_-_10_Epic_Song)
 - ExplosiveJames made the Hammer

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Can I use my own art?</summary>

Of course, this tutorial only assumes that you are using sprites.  You can use any art in the game you'd like.

For sounds, we don't have many - just enough to introduce how they may be added to a game.  Unity supports many formats including wav and mp3 you could use.

<br>Can I use sprite sheets?

Yes, but Unity occasionally has render issues while using sprite sheets.   Sprite sheets are an optimization technique games use. Unity has a sprite packer feature that can be used to automatically create sprite sheets.  Once you are in the optimization phase of your project, you could look into the sprite packer to try and gain anything that might have been lost from using individual sprites instead.

<br>Can I use Vectors?

No.  Unity does not support vector graphics out of the box, you could look in the Asset Store for a 3rd party solution.

<hr></details>
</details>


## 1.3) Configure sprites

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/661557efa406c565c0dcacc66b309a5746ed03d6.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/cb9527525820b72f3a8dbff786153b92a6c2ebc4.zip)

Update each sprite to use mesh type full rect and point filter mode.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Select all the sprites**:

 - Search by Type: **Texture** (not sprite!)

<img src=http://i.imgur.com/0rDoj6V.png width=300px>

 - Click on one and Ctrl+A to select all.

<br>**Update import settings**:

 - In the Inspector, set Mesh Type: 'Full Rect'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Dhe3Nzt.png" width=300px />

 - Set Filter Mode: 'Point (no filter)'

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/B0nqf75.png" width=300px />

 - 'Apply' changes.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What is mesh type / full rect?</summary>

When a sprite is rendered to the screen, a combination of a mesh (like used for 3D objects) outlining the sprite and transparency is used to draw the picture on screen.  Tradeoffs here are beyond the scope of this tutorial.

 - Tight will attempt to better outline the sprite, using more polygons in the mesh.
 - Full Rect will use 2 triangles per sprite.

When using tiling on a sprite, Unity recommends updating the sprite sheet to use 'Full Rect'.  I don't have an example of issues that may arise from using 'Tight' instead, but here is the warning from Unity recommending 'Full Rect':

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/e9jE83B.png" width=300px />

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What is filter mode / point?</summary>

Using point filter mode gets us closer to pixel perfect sprites and prevents some visual glitches.

Filter mode of Bilinear or Trilinear blurs the image a bit in attempt to make smooth lines.  Often for a 2D game, we want control down to the pixel and this effect is not desirable.  Here's an example with the character sprite we will be using:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/AYyx3Ma.png" width=150px />

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8wMlM1S.png"  width=150px />

For sprite sheets, often each object is touching the one next to it.  Filter Mode Point prevents blending happening between one sprite and it's neighbor.  The blending that occurs with other modes besides Point may lead to random lines showing up on screen.  For example:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZKqg5JP.png" width=300px />

<hr></details>


## 1.4) Disable anti-aliasing

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/cb9527525820b72f3a8dbff786153b92a6c2ebc4.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/0c2993c651a60b56e583c80d1006f232c93539b3.zip)

Disable anti-aliasing for each quality level.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Disable anti-aliasing**:

 - Open Quality settings:
   - Menu 'Edit' -> 'Project Settings' -> 'Quality'.
 - In the Inspector:
   - Anti Aliasing: Disabled

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/auHPjbi.png" width=300px />

<br>**Repeat for each quality 'Level'**:

   - Click on the row to modify (e.g. 'Very High').
   - Update anti aliasing if needed.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KYym6V0.png" width=300px />

 - Click 'Ultra' to resume testing with the best settings.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What is anti aliasing?</summary>

Anti aliasing is a technique used to smooth jagged edges as shown here:

<img src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-10856ecbea4f439fb9fb751d41ff704a" width=150px />

Disabling anti aliasing gets us closer to pixel perfect sprites and prevents some visual glitches, particularly when using sprite sheets. Like changing the filter mode to Point, we do this when working with sprites because we often want control over images down to the pixel.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why do we need to change this setting multiple times?</summary>

The highlighted 'Level' is what you are testing with ATM.  It will default to Ultra.  The green checkboxes represent the default quality level for different build types.  To avoid artifacts, we disable anti aliasing in every level and then switch back to Ultra so that we are testing with the best settings.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not update the camera instead?</summary>

In the camera in your scene has an option to not 'Allow MSAA'.  Disabling this will turn off Anti-Aliasing as we had done above.  Since Anti-Aliasing is disabled in the project settings this checkbox has not effect.

You could opt to disable Anti-Aliasing in the camera and not in the project settings - however if you do be sure that cameras you use in other scenes have the same settings.

<hr></details>

## 1.5) Select an aspect ratio

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/0c2993c651a60b56e583c80d1006f232c93539b3.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/5ac85f3ad1388fd306d6cbf05a6b47d75fc67c9e.zip)

Change the aspect ratio to 5:4 in the Game window and build settings.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Game window**:

 - In the 'Game' window:
    - Change 'Free Aspect' to '5:4'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MTnZtu4.png" width=300px />

<br>**Build settings**:

 - Open menu File -> 'Build Settings'.
   - Select the desired platform and click 'Player Settings'.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/R1B43yZ.png" width=300px />

 - In the Inspector:
   - Set the supported resolution **or** aspect ratio.
 
PC:

Web GL: 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/NhCWDTp.png" width=300px />

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Why use a fixed aspect ratio?</summary>

We are building a game with a fixed display.  The camera is not going to follow the character which will simplify the game and level design for this tutorial.  With a fixed aspect ratio we can design a scene without any camera movement and be sure everyone has the same experience.

The white box here represents the area that players will see:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/eIq2LD2.png" width=300px />

Different resolutions will scale the display larger or smaller but everyone will see the same amount of the world.

5:4 was an arbitrary choice, use anything you'd like.

<hr></details>


## 1.6) Configure camera

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/5ac85f3ad1388fd306d6cbf05a6b47d75fc67c9e.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3afc4bcb1bf60c00d7dd13b0e358da17b03fac80.zip)

Update the camera size and background color.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - In the 'Hierarchy' window:
   - Select the 'Main Camera'.
 - In the Inspector:
   - Set Size: 10

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/PmeoqG7.png" width=300px />

 - Change the 'Background' color to black.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QKGcl9o.png" width=300px />

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What is camera 'Size'?</summary>

2D games by default use 'Projection: Orthographic'.  This means that the camera does not consider perspective, the ability to see more of the world the further it is from your eye. 

For an Orthographic camera, the amount of the world visible is driven by a special 'Size' property. 'Size' defines how much of the world is visible vertically.  Then the aspect ratio is used to determine how much to display horizontally.

The amount of the world visible with a perspective camera, as used in 3D, is driven by it's position.  

We used size to zoom out so that more of the world is visible on screen.  In the Scene, the white box representing the viewable area has grown.

<hr></details>


## 1.7) Add an auto save script 

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3afc4bcb1bf60c00d7dd13b0e358da17b03fac80.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/6d5419dfad076bb91221446e8fe4995107efa6c2.zip)

Create an editor script which automatically saves every time you hit play.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - In the Project window Assets folder:
   - Right click Create -> New Folder 
   - Name it **Code**
 - Create folder Assets/Code/**Editor**.
 - In the Assets/Code/Editor directory:
   - Select 'Create' -> 'C# Script'
   - Name it **AutoSave**
 - Double click to open the file in Visual Studio.
 - Paste in the the following source code:
   - Or view the [full version with comments](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/blob/6d5419dfad076bb91221446e8fe4995107efa6c2/Assets/Code/Editor/AutoSave.cs).


```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEditor.SceneManagement;

[InitializeOnLoad]
public class AutoSave
{ 
  static AutoSave()
  {
    EditorApplication.playmodeStateChanged
      += OnPlaymodeStateChanged;
  }

  static void OnPlaymodeStateChanged()
  {
    if(EditorApplication.isPlaying == false)
    {
      EditorSceneManager.SaveOpenScenes();
    }
  }
}
```


<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>How do I know it's working?</summary>

AutoSave is a script which will only run while testing in the Unity Editor.  Every time you hit play, the scene and project will save just before play begins.

You can confirm the save is working by noting the * in Unity's title.  This * indicates unsaved changes and should now go away every time you click play.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why is the folder name important?</summary>

Unity uses special folder names to drive certain capabilities.  Any script under a folder named "Editor" will only run while testing in the Unity editor (vs in your built game).

[Read more](
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html) from Unity.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's InitializeOnLoad?</summary>

InitializeOnLoad is an attribute which enables the script.  The static constructor of any class with this attribute is executed before anything else in the game.

InitializeOnLoad is an editor only script and found under the UnityEditor namespace.

</details>
<details><summary>What's a C# attribute?</summary>

Attributes in C# are metadata added to classes, fields, or methods that may be queried by other classes.  In the AutoSave script, InitializeOnLoad, a Unity specific attribute, is used to ensure the static constructor on our AutoSave class is called when the game begins.

There are many [standard C# attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/index) and [Unity specific attributes](http://www.tallior.com/unity-attributes/) that may be used.  Here are examples of several attributes you might use:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Networking;

// Tells unity that this component only works
// if the GameObject also has a SpriteRenderer
[RequireComponent(typeof(SpriteRenderer))]
public class MyClassName : MonoBehaviour
{
  // Tells unity this field can be modified
  // in the inspector
  [SerializeField]
  // Limits the values you can enter 
  // in the inspector
  [Range(1, 10)]
  int count;

  // Used for multiplayer games to sync 
  // method calls
  [ClientRpc]
  void MyMethod() { }
}
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a C# static constructor?</summary>

Every object in C# may include a static constructor, this applies to static and non-static classes.  A static constructor is guaranteed to be called once (and only once).  The constructor will run before the first object is instantiated, a field is accessed, or a method is called (i.e. it happens before you touch the class).  You never call the static constructor directly.

A static constructor is a private static method named the same as the class, with no parameters and no return type.

```csharp
public class MyClassName 
{
  static MyClassName() 
  {
    // This is executed once automatically, before we do 
    // anything else with MyClassName.
  }
}
```
<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a C# delegate / event?</summary>

A delegate in C# is an object representing method(s) to call at a later time. You may encounter delegates under the following names: Events, Action, Func, and delegate. Under the hood these are all implemented with a 'multicast delegate'.  

When a method is added to a delegate to be called later, this is referred to as 'subscribing'.  Multicast delegate means that any number of methods may subscribe to the same delegate.  We use += when subscribing so not to overwrite any other subscribers.

```csharp
EditorApplication.playmodeStateChanged += OnPlaymodeStateChanged;
```

If the owner of the delegate (in the example above that's EditorApplication) may outlive the subscriber, the subscriber should unsubscribe when it's destroyed.  Also, any time you are no longer interested in future updates, unsubscribe.  We do this with -= to remove our method and leave any remaining methods subscribed.

```csharp
EditorApplication.playmodeStateChanged -= OnPlaymodeStateChanged;
```

Events are a common use case for delegates.  For example, you may have a GameManager with a field for Points include an event "onPointsChange".  Other components/systems in the game, such as Achievements and the UI, may subscribe to the onPointsChange event.  When a player earns points, a method in Achievements is then called which can consider awarding a high score achievement and a method in the UI is called to refresh what the player sees on-screen.  This way those components only need to refresh when something has changed as opposed to checking the current state each frame.

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

public static class GameManager
{
  public static event Action onPointsChange;
  static int _points;
  public static int points
  {
    get
    {
      return _points;
    }
    set
    {
      _points = value;
      if(onPointsChange != null)
      {
        onPointsChange();
      }
    }
  }
}

public class MyCustomComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void Awake()
  {
    GameManager.onPointsChange 
      += GameManager_onPointsChange; 
  }

  protected void OnDestroy()
  {
    GameManager.onPointsChange
      -= GameManager_onPointsChange;
  }

  void GameManager_onPointsChange()
  {
    // React to points changing
  }
}
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What about performance?</summary>

As an editor script, this logic is not included in the game you release.  Saving is incremental so there is very little time wasted when there is nothing new to save.  Unless you're one of the lucky ones who never sees Unity crash, this script is absolutely worth the time tradeoff.

<hr></details>

## 1.8) To review

Your project is now setup for 2D and we have lots of assets imported to choose from.

<details><summary>Testing / debugging tips</summary>

 - Drag / drop a sprite into the scene:  
   - Zoom in to get a good look. 
   - Try changing settings such as changing the filter mode to see what it's impacting.
   - When done, select the GameObject that was created in the Hierarchy window and hit Delete.
 - Aspect Ratio may need to be set again later. 
   - Aspect Ratio is an editor setting.  Sometimes the aspect ratio will reset, such as if you were testing another project.  Just note that this may happen and when it does, change the aspect ratio back again.
 - You could add more assets.  We are especially light on sounds.  
   - You do not need to follow our guide exactly.  Use your own art and sounds, and when we start implementing mechanics, you can deviate there as well to create something unique.

</details>

<details><summary>How-to setup a GIT repository</summary>

You may want to use GIT for your project's version control.  I recommend this even if you are working alone as when something goes wrong, and it will, you can diff against previous versions to help narrow down the issue.

Github is free for public open-source projects like the code used in this tutorial.  Other services work basically the same, including Gitlab which I use for free private repositories.

 - On Github's website, click the plus to create a new Repository.
   - Select Unity for the gitignore file.

<img src=http://i.imgur.com/x42fqWe.png width=300px>

Once the project is created, hit the Clone button to get the repository's URL.

<img src=http://i.imgur.com/knuD9vt.png width=300px>

 - Install GIT
   - You can use the [command line tools](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or a GUI such [GitExtensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/). 

The following steps are written for the command line, but if using a GUI just look for the same keywords.

 - Open command prompt
 - Change directory to your project
 - Run the following commands:

```
git init
git remote add origin <Your repository's URL>
git pull
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Now anytime you want to check in changes, run the following:

```
git add .
git push 
```
