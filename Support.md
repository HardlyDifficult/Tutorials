# Supporting Hardly Difficult by Mining BitCoin

You can support me by running NiceHash while your computer is idle!  This costs you nothing and could add up if a few chip in.

 - Download NiceHash Miner: [miner.nicehash.com](https://miner.nicehash.com/)
   - The 'NVIDIA' works with the CPU even if your GPU is not supported.
 - Click 'Wallet' and enter:

```

```

That's it!  You can see stats while it runs, and online.  It pays out a penny every few minutes. I'll also get a view showing contributions.

Optionally you can:

 - Click 'Worker' and enter your name (or stay anonymous).  I'll see this on reports.
 - Click 'Configuration' and check both boxes so it runs while your computer is idle.
 - Add NiceHash to startup.  
   - Run "shell:startup" which opens a folder, add a copy of the NiceHash shortcut.

NiceHash is selling your computer's time to other miners.  So the pay out is per hour and not the usual miner reward (which is more like winning a lottery).

Anyone can view stats and contributors here: [nicehash.com/miner/3KS9rE6YqGYZyh2wdM5dzNWVP6k2ht7CZy](https://www.nicehash.com/miner/3KS9rE6YqGYZyh2wdM5dzNWVP6k2ht7CZy)
