# 10) Hammer


 - Select the Hammer prefab:
   - Add **FadeInThenEnable** (nothing needed in the to enable list).


## 10.1) Create a Hammer

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/9_6_TowardsCenter.zip) | [Source after]()

Create a Hammer prefab and then layout several in the world.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Change the sprite's pivot to Bottom. We are using **Hammer**.
 - Add to the world and scale (to about .2).
 - Add a **PolygonCollider2D**:
   - Check Is Trigger.
 - Create a prefab.
 - Add several Hammers and lay them out for the level.

<br>Hammer blinks red before despawning:

 - Create script Components/Death/**DeathEffectFlash**:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class DeathEffectFlash : DeathEffect
{
  [SerializeField]
  float lengthToFlashFor = 5;

  [SerializeField]
  float timePerColorChange = .75f;

  [SerializeField]
  float colorChangeTimeFactorPerFlash = .85f;

  public override float timeUntilObjectMayBeDestroyed
  {
    get
    {
      return lengthToFlashFor;
    }
  }

  public override void PlayDeathEffects()
  {
    StartCoroutine(FlashToDeath());
  }

  IEnumerator FlashToDeath()
  {
    SpriteRenderer[] spriteList 
      = GetComponentsInChildren<SpriteRenderer>();
    float timePassed = 0;
    bool isRed = false;
    while(timePassed < lengthToFlashFor)
    {
      SetColor(spriteList, isRed ? Color.red : Color.white);
      isRed = !isRed;

      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timePerColorChange);
      timePerColorChange = Mathf.Max(Time.deltaTime, timePerColorChange);
      timePassed += timePerColorChange;
      timePerColorChange *= colorChangeTimeFactorPerFlash;
    }
  }

  void SetColor(
    SpriteRenderer[] spriteList,
    Color color)
  {
    for(int i = 0; i < spriteList.Length; i++)
    {
      SpriteRenderer sprite = spriteList[i];
      sprite.color = color;
    }
  }
}
```

 - Add **DeathEffectFlash** to the hammer prefab, (it should automatically add DeathEffectManager as well).


<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

We sized the hammer to be about as large as the character.  You could go larger or smaller if you think that looks better.  

However we are using a polygon collider, which outlines the sprite art. In order for the hammer to kill an enemy later on, the hammer needs to make contact with the enemy before the character's body does.  If the hammer is too small, the character may start dying instead.

3 were placed around the level.  Add as many as you'd like, but when positioning be sure that the hammer is in a location the player can get too.  It's frustrating for players if they see a hammer but can't ever reach it.

Picking up the hammer and killing enemies with it is covered in the next sections.


<br>Hammer blinks red before despawning:

DeathEffectFlash will start when another component triggers death on the GameObject (using DeathEffectManager).  Over a period of time the sprite will flash red faster and faster until the object dies.  

This is added to the hammer and the effect begins when SuicideIn's time completes.  When configuring the length of time a player has the hammer for, sum the SuicideIn time as well as the length to flash for configured in DeathEffectFlash.

The other fields in DeathEffectFlash may be used to control how quickly flash occurs as well as how it accelerates over time.  You could play with these values or modify the formula use in FlashToDeath to create your own effect.
<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use pivot bottom?</summary>

We will be equipping the hammer on the character and have him swing.  Moving the pivot point to bottom sets it to approximately where the character will grip the hammer.  

When rotating the hammer for a swing, the bottom pivot causes the bottom of the handle to keep its position while the hammer's head swings.  The default middle pivot would create equal motion at the hammer's head and the base of the hammer's handle.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUoyqJ3.gif" width=300px />

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a polygon collider and not a box or capsule?</summary>

You could.  

The hammer's shape does not match either a Box or Capsule collider.  If you were to use one of those, the difference between the collider and the sprite art could be great enough that collisions in the game feel wrong.  e.g., you may miss picking up a hammer you thought you got or not kill an enemy you clearly hit.

The hammer's shape could be approximated well by using 2 box colliders.  A polygon collider does require more processing time, although not a significant difference, so this may be a potential optimization worth the tradeoff sacrificing some precision on collisions.  

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use Is Trigger?</summary>

When the character jumps for the hammer to pick it up, we do not want the character to bounce off of it.  The collider used on the hammer when the hammer is a pick up item shouldn't respond to anything expect equipping when the character touches it.  This is best achieved with 'Is Trigger'.

<hr></details>

<details><summary>Why not simply sum the time used in WaitForSeconds instead of max with deltaTime?</summary>

In the following example, we are requesting the coroutine sleep for a period of time:

```csharp
yield return new WaitForSeconds(timePerColorChange);
timePerColorChange = Mathf.Max(Time.deltaTime, timePerColorChange);
```

Unity does not make any guarantee that the amount of time before the coroutine resumes aligns with the wait time requested.  If we request a near zero time to wait, Unity will wait for a single frame -- we want to ensure that the effect progresses by at least that amount of time as well.

Additionally, this simplistic algorithm may drive the variable timePerColorChange to zero.  If that number got small enough, the loop would never terminate.  Ensuring that we progress by at least deltaTime each frame ensures that the loop will end.

Alternatively this method could be rewritten to use Time.timeSinceLevelLoaded.  With that we do not need to sum each iteration but instead can make decisions based off of the current time vs the time the effect began.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use GetComponentsInChildren instead of a single sprite?</summary>

Flexibility.  Some use cases would work with GetComponent or GetComponentInChildren.  We get all the sprites in this GameObject and its children, and then update all so if something is composed of multiple sprites this script just works. 

<hr></details>

## 10.2) Equip the hammer

[YouTube]() | [Source before]() | [Source after]()

Add a script to the hammer and character, allowing the character to pickup the hammer and then kill enemies until it despawns.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Create script Components/Weapons/**WeaponHolder**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class WeaponHolder : MonoBehaviour
{
  public GameObject currentWeapon;
}
```

 - Add **WeaponHolder** to the Character.
 - Create script Components/Weapons/**Hammer**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Hammer : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  Vector2 positionWhenEquip = new Vector2(.214f, .17f);

  [SerializeField]
  Vector3 rotationWhenEquipInEuler = new Vector3(0, 0, -90);

  [SerializeField]
  MonoBehaviour[] componentListToEnableOnEquip;

  WeaponHolder currentHolder;

  protected void OnDestroy()
  {
    if(currentHolder != null)
    {
      currentHolder.currentWeapon = null;
    }
  }

  protected void OnTriggerEnter2D(
    Collider2D collision)
  {
    WeaponHolder holder = collision.GetComponent<WeaponHolder>();
    if(holder != null && currentHolder == null && holder.currentWeapon == null)
    {
      currentHolder = holder;
      currentHolder.currentWeapon = gameObject;

      transform.SetParent(currentHolder.transform);
      transform.localPosition = positionWhenEquip;
      transform.localRotation = Quaternion.Euler(rotationWhenEquipInEuler);

      for(int i = 0; i < componentListToEnableOnEquip.Length; i++)
      {
        MonoBehaviour component = componentListToEnableOnEquip[i];
        component.enabled = true;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

 - Select the Hammer prefab:
   - Add **SuicideIn**:
     - Time Till Death: 10
     - Disable the component.
   - Add **KillOnContactWith**:
     - Layers to kill: Enemy
     - Disable the component.
   - Add **Hammer**:
     - Add SuicideIn and KillOnContactWith components to the list 'To Enable On Equip'.
 - Select the SpikeBall prefab:
   - Add **DeathEffectSpawn**:
     - GameObject to spawn: the Explosion prefab

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

We create a weapon holder component to ensure we don't hold more than one weapon at a time.  When the weapon despawns (i.e., OnDestroy), we free up the Character's weapon holder so it can pick up another.

When the character picks up a hammer, the hammer becomes a child of the Character GameObject.  The hammer is then given a local position and rotation which represents where to grip the hammer relative to the character's feet (because the character has a bottom pivot point).  

When the hammer is equip, a list of components are enabled.  We use use this to make the necessary changes to switch this from a pickup item to a limited time killing machine.  

 - SuicideIn creates a timer till despawn.
 - KillOnContactWith enables killing enemies, previously disabled because it would be usual for the hammer as a pickup item to kill passers by.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Could we reset the timer instead of preventing a second pickup?</summary>

Yes, in fact that would better match how most games would implement this feature.  There are various ways, as always, to achieve this. For example when the character touches a second hammer, you could:

 - Destroy the first and then simply allow the second to play out.  However the animation of the hammer swing may visibly skip.
 - Reset the SuicideIn countdown and Destroy the second hammer.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why serialize the rotation as Vector3 instead of Quaternion?</summary>

Quaternions are confusing for people.  This is why the Transform rotation is modified in the Inspector as an Euler.  Unfortunately when you ask Unity to expose a Quaternion in the Inspector it appears as X, Y, Z, W and not the Euler X, Y, Z like they did for the Transform.

You could switch to Quaternion, and it would be slightly more performant that way.  But I recommend using Euler, in case you ever want to modify the rotation used.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's localPosition / localRotation and how do they differ from position / rotation?</summary>

When modifying the Transform position - you can do so with either .position or .localPosition.  When the GameObject is a child of another GameObject these methods differ; they do the same thing when the GameObject has no parent.

 - .position: Sets the Transform position so that the GameObject appears at that location after considering the parent's Transform (position, rotation, and scale).
 - .localPosition: Sets the Transform position to the value specified.  If the GameObject has a parent, the parent's Transform will impact the final position you see in the scene.

## 10.3) Hammer animation 

[YouTube]() | [Source before]() | [Source after]()

Create an animation for the hammer swinging.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Open menu Window -> Animation.
 - Select a Hammer.
 - Click create, save as Animations/**HammerSwing**.anim

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kokz29S.png" width=300px />

 - Click the red record button.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bha8EJC.png" width=150px />

 - Modify the rotation, then set it back to 0, creating a keyframe for the default rotation.
 - Double click under 1:00 to create another keyframe.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZVNovlp.png" width=300px />

 - Switch the current time position (the white line) to 0:10.
 - Change rotation to (0, 0, -90).
 - Click record to stop recording.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

We created an animation for the Hammer, which automatically created the Animator Controller and a default state to play that animation.

If you hit play now, the hammer will be swinging in place.  In the next couple sections we will change this to trigger the animation at the right time.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a 1:00, what if I want to speed up the animation?</summary>

Unity offers a few different ways you could speed up an animation.  They are all valid, use what you are comfortable with. 

I prefer to get the sequence and relative timing for animation correct using the Animation timeline, and then using the Animator Controller state to modify the playback speed for that animation.  As animations get more complex, making updates to the animation timeline is more tedious which is why I prefer using the 'speed' field.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How do keyframes work / what happens between keyframes?</summary>

A keyframe is a datapoint on the timeline.  Between each keyframe, Unity will smoothly transition from the previous keyframe to the next.  If you open the "Curves" tab you can see a graph showing how this transition occurs, and you make make modifications there directly.

<hr></details>

## 10.4) Start swinging hammer on equip

[YouTube]() | [Source before]() | [Source after]()

Add a script to the hammer to start the swing animation when it's equip.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Stop swinging by default:

 - Select a Hammer.
 - Open menu Window -> Animator.
   - Right click -> Create State -> Empty.  
   - Select the box which appeared and in the Inspector name it "Idle".
   - Right click "Idle" and 'Set as Layer Default State'.


 - Create script Components/Effects/**PlayAnimationOnEnable**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Animator))]
public class PlayAnimationOnEnable : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  string animationToPlay;

  Animator animator;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    animator = GetComponent<Animator>();
  }

  protected void OnEnable()
  {
    animator.Play(animationToPlay);
  }
}
```

 - Select the Hammer prefab:
   - Add **PlayAnimationOnEnable**.
     - Animation to play: "HammerSwing"
     - Disable the PlayAnimationOnEnable component.
   - Add the PlayAnimationOnEnable component to the Hammer component's 'To Enable' list.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

An Animator Controller always requires at least one state be active. We created a state which does nothing and made that the default so the hammer does not move until another component switches the state to HammerSwing, starting the animation.

When the Hammer component is touched by the Character, it will enable the PlayAnimationOnEnable component which starts the swing animation.  

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How does animator.Play work?</summary>

Calling Play on the animator will interrupt the current animation, if there is one, and start playing the one requested.  You pass the name of the Animator State from its Animator Controller, which in turn has a reference to the animation clip to play.  Any parameters defined in the animator state apply, including Speed.
