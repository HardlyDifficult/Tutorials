## 5.1) Spawn in a Hovering Enemy

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/78517829d5603648eabeafb10eb441912f5db194.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/HoverGuySpawn.zip)

Spawn in a new enemy which hovers above the ground.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create the HoverGuy**:

 - Select **flyMan_fly**, **_jump**, and **_stand** and drag them into the Scene, creating Assets/Animations/**HoverGuyWalk**.
   - Order in Layer: 1
 - Add the sprite to a parent GameObject named "HoverGuy":
   - Layer: Enemy
   - Add a **Rigidbody2D**:
     - Freeze the Z rotation.
   - Add a **CapsuleCollider2D**:
     - Adjust the size to fit the sprite's body.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/d1lxoEj.png" width=150px />

<br>**Make HoverGuy float**:

 - Create a Layer for "Feet".
 - Update the Physics 2D collision matrix:
   - Disable Feet / Enemy.
   - Disable Feet / Feet.
 - Add an empty GameObject named "Feet" as a child under the HoverGuy.
   - Layer: Feet
   - Add a **CircleCollider2D**
     - Radius: .1
     - Position it a little below the sprite.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BPohw5V.png" width=150px />

 - Create a prefab Assets/Prefabs/**HoverGuy** and delete the GameObject.

<br>**Add a spawner**:

- Drag in each of the door sprites one at a time.  We are using **doorOpen_mid** and **_top**.
   - Order in Layer: -20
 - Add them to a parent named "Door":
   - Scale up the size of the Door to (1.5, 1.5, 1.5).
   - Move the door to the bottom left of the level.
     - Position its Y so that the midpoint of the Door approximately aligns with the midpoint of the HoverGuy (at the height we would want it to spawn).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EjVJkZ4.gif" width=300px />

 - Move the sprite for the top into position, then vertex snap the bottom.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SF57oFs.gif" width=150px />

 - Select the Door and add **Spawner**:
   - Thing to spawn: HoverGuy

<br>**Test**:

 - A HoverGuy should spawn in instantly.  It'll stand there above the ground kicking its feet, but not moving.  HoverGuys will continue to spawn on top of each other.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>How do you know what size to make the second collider?</summary>

It does not matter much.  This second collider's only purpose is to ensure that the HoverGuy hovers above the ground.  So in a sense, we only need a single pixel to represent the correct Y position for Unity physics to use, represented by the bottom of this circle collider.

By default, Unity physics uses discrete collisions instead of continuous.

 - Discrete means that each FixedUpdate, collisions are considered for the object's current position.
 - Continuous means that each FixedUpdate, collisions consider the entire path the object has taken since the last FixedUpdate.

Discrete is the default because it is more performant.  However, Discrete is also less accurate.

When a collider is too small, collisions may be missed entirely as the object changes from a little above to a little below an obstacle. For example, this is a common problem when shooting - bullets may start to travel through walls instead of hitting them.

The collider may also be too large, causing our HoverGuy to continue standing on a platform when he should have fallen off the edge.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a child GameObject instead of two colliders on the parent?</summary>

You could opt to do this using just one GameObject instead.

The second collider we added is configured to collide with platforms, but not with the character or other entities. This allows it to prop up the HoverGuy, making it hover above the ground.

We don't want the 'feet' to collide with the character, because later in the tutorial we will be adding ladders. While the HoverGuy is on a ladder, the character can walk underneath. If the feet could hit the character, he may die unexpectedly.

We are using a child GameObject for the HoverGuy's feet in order to simplify future components.  Specifically, we will be creating a FloorDetector that will need to know which collider represents the bottom of the object.

<hr></details>

## 5.2) Make the HoverGuy Walk

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/HoverGuySpawn.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/HoverGuyWalk.zip)

Add a script to the HoverGuy to drive random walk movement.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create WanderWalkController**:

 - Create script Code/Movement/**[WanderWalkController](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/blob/HoverGuyWalk/Assets/Code/Movement/WanderWalkController.cs)**:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(WalkMovement))]
public class WanderWalkController : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float timeBeforeFirstWander = 10;

  [SerializeField]
  float minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 1;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 10;

  WalkMovement walkMovement;

  protected void Awake()
  {
    walkMovement = GetComponent<WalkMovement>();
  }

  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(Wander());
  }

  IEnumerator Wander()
  {
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection = 1;

    if(timeBeforeFirstWander > 0)
    {
      float timeToSleep = timeBeforeFirstWander + GetRandomTimeToSleep();
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeToSleep);
    }

    while(true)
    {
      SelectARandomWalkDirection();
      float timeToSleep = GetRandomTimeToSleep();
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeToSleep);
    }
  }

  void SelectARandomWalkDirection()
  {
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
      = UnityEngine.Random.value <= .5f ? 1 : -1;
  }

  float GetRandomTimeToSleep()
  {
    return UnityEngine.Random.Range(
      minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection,
      maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection);
  }
}
```

<br>**Configure HoverGuy**:

 - Add **WanderWalkController** to the HoverGuy (it should automatically add WalkMovement as well).

<br>**Test**:

 - The HoverGuys should start to walk right when they spawn, then a few seconds later begin periodically choosing a random direction.
   - Note that at the moment, HoverGuys will walk right off the screen.  This will be addressed soon.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

using clauses at the top of a file brings APIs into scope. Used for:

- System.Collections.IEnumerator
- UnityEngine.Debug
- UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour
- UnityEngine.RequireComponentAttribute
- UnityEngine.SerializeFieldAttribute
- UnityEngine.WaitForSeconds

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute which informs the editor that this script requires a WalkMovement component on the GameObject.

```csharp
[RequireComponent(typeof(WalkMovement))]
```

We inherit from MonoBehaviour, which allows this script to be added as a component on a GameObject.

public is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
public class WanderWalkController : MonoBehaviour
{
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute that exposes a field in the Inspector, allowing you to configure it for the object.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
```

This defines how long to walk right before possibly switching directions.  The default value here can be changed in the Inspector.

```csharp
  float timeBeforeFirstWander = 10;
```

After the initial timeBeforeFirstWander, this script will select a random direction and then wait a random amount of time. These values may be changed in the Inspector, allowing you to modify how frequently objects might turn.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  float minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 1;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection = 10;
```

This is a reference to the WalkMovement component on this GameObject, cached here for performance.

```csharp
  WalkMovement walkMovement;
```

Awake is a Unity event which is called once for a component when it's first added to a Scene.

protected is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void Awake()
  {
```

Here we get a reference to the WalkMovement component on this GameObject.

```csharp
    walkMovement = GetComponent<WalkMovement>();
  }
```

protected is optional here. Used for consistency.

Start is a Unity event which is called once for a component, the first time it is enabled.

```csharp
  protected void Start()
  {
```

This starts the coroutine below, which will run until this GameObject is destroyed or deactivated.

```csharp
    StartCoroutine(Wander());
  }
```

This is the coroutine which periodically changes walk direction.

```csharp
  IEnumerator Wander()
  {
```

Here we start by walking right for a period of time before considering a random direction.  We do this because it's a simple way to support the level design we are using.  To skip the initial direction entirely, you can set the timeBeforeFirstWander to 0.

You may want to extend this script to have a configurable initial direction.

```csharp
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection = 1;
```

If timeBeforeFirstWander is 0, we would rather move right into the loop, selecting a random starting direction.

```csharp
    if(timeBeforeFirstWander > 0)
    {
```

Here we calculate how long to wait before selecting the first random direction.  We are using the configure timeBeforeFirstWander plus a random additional time in order to ensure the first turn HoverGuys take is not predicable.

```csharp
      float timeToSleep = timeBeforeFirstWander + GetRandomTimeToSleep();
```

Here we pause this coroutine for the time calculated above, and then proceed into the loop below.

```csharp
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeToSleep);
    }
```

We loop forever. The only way to stop this is to stop the coroutine, either by calling an API to stop it or by destroying or disabling this GameObject.

```csharp
    while(true)
    {
```

Here we call our helper method below to consider changing directions.

```csharp
      SelectARandomWalkDirection();
```

This calculates how long to pause before considering changing directions again.

```csharp
      float timeToSleep = GetRandomTimeToSleep();
```

Here we pause this coroutine for the time calculated above, and then loop to consider changing directions again.

```csharp
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeToSleep);
    }
  }
```

This is a helper method for selecting a direction to walk.

```csharp
  void SelectARandomWalkDirection()
  {
```

Here we get a random number between 0 and 1.  If it's less than or equal to .5, go right otherwise go left.

We make the request to the WalkMovement component which will then move our GameObject.

```csharp
    walkMovement.desiredWalkDirection
      = UnityEngine.Random.value <= .5f ? 1 : -1;
  }
```

This is a helper method for selecting a random time to wait between direction selection attempt.

```csharp
  float GetRandomTimeToSleep()
  {
```

This returns a random number greater than or equal to minTime and less than or equal to maxTime specified in the Inspector.

```csharp
    return UnityEngine.Random.Range(
      minTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection,
      maxTimeBetweenReconsideringDirection);
  }
}
```

</details>
<details><summary>How might we improve on WanderWalkController?</summary>

WanderWalkController is a controller to drive the WalkMovement component, similar to how the PlayerController does.

The PlayerController reads input from the keyboard (or controller) and feeds that to WalkMovement.  WanderWalkController uses RNG to effectively do the same, simulating holding the right or left button.

WanderWalkController will always request movement either left or right.  It starts by going right for a period of time and then chooses directions randomly.

You could extend this logic to have the HoverGuy occasionally stand in the same place for a moment before continuing on or to speed him up, like the PlayerController does, instead of simply setting desiredWalkDirection to 1 or -1.

Update the door so that it does not spawn if the character is too close.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Add a trigger**:

 - Select the Door:
   - Add a **BoxCollider2D**:
     - Check Is Trigger.
     - Size it to cover the entrance area.

    }
  }
}
```

<br>**Configure Character**:

 - Create a Layer for "Character".
 - Update the Physics 2D collision matrix:
   - Disable Character / Feet.
 - Change the Character GameObject to Layer Character.

<br>**Configure EvilCloud**:

 - Select the EvilCloud, and under the Spawner component:
   - Check Use Layer Mask
   - Layer Mask: Character and Enemy

<br>**Test**:

 - Move the Character to the door and then hit play.  While you stand there, no HoverGuy should spawn.  Walk away and spawn should resume.
 - If there is a HoverGuy or SpikeBall in the entrance area, spawning should pause until it leaves.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

This is a Unity-specific attribute that exposes a field in the Inspector, allowing you to configure it for the object.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
```

This defines a filter for which object types to include when checking if the area is clear.  Set in the Inspector.

```csharp
  ContactFilter2D contactFilter;
```

This is a reference to the collider on this GameObject, cached here for performance.

```csharp
  Collider2D safeZoneCollider;
```

This is a list to use when calling OverlapCollider.  Here so that we can reuse the array each time, improving performance.

```csharp
  static readonly Collider2D[] tempColliderList = new Collider2D[1];
```

Awake is a Unity event which is called once for a component when it's first added to a Scene.

protected is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void Awake()
  {
```

Here we get a reference to the collider on this GameObject.

```csharp
    safeZoneCollider = GetComponent<Collider2D>();
  }
```

If we have a collider, check if there is an entity in the area which should block spawn.  We use OverlapCollider with a filter and then check the number of results found.

We do not need any information from the tempColliderList.  However, this list is used to define the max number of results Unity should return.  We have size 1 as all we want to know is if there are 0 or more entities in the area.

```csharp
      if(safeZoneCollider == null
        || safeZoneCollider.OverlapCollider(
          contactFilter, tempColliderList) == 0)
```

</details>
<details><summary>How do I know what size to make the collider?</summary>

The collider we added defines the area to check for the character before allowing a spawn to happen.  We make this large enough to cover the entire entrance area so that there is never a HoverGuy that spawns in and instantly kills the character, leaving the player feeling cheated.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does OverlapCollider do?</summary>

In script, we check for entities in area by using OverlapCollider.  This is an on-demand way to check for colliders.  The contact filter filters results so that only entities are considered, and not get interrupted by a nearby platform.

We could have chosen to use OnTriggerEnter and OnTriggerExit instead; however, this approach was chosen both because it's simple and works well for this use case, and because it exposes us to multiple different techniques during this tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a contact filter instead of a tag or a layermask?</summary>

You could, but it may change how we interact with Unity here.  OverlapCollider answers our question of whether the character is in the area, and it accepts a ContactFilter2D.

ContactFilter2D may be used to filter results on various dimensions when making calls such as OverlapCollider.  LayerMask is the only one we are interested in here.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Does the Collision Matrix impact anything when using OverlapCollider?</summary>

No.  The collision matrix as defined under the Physics 2D settings only impacts the real-time collisions from Unity.  Calls such as OverlapCollider do not assume the same restrictions that may have been applied in the collision matrix.  This provides a lot of flexibility for different mechanics.

If you do want to use the same LayerMask as defined in the collision matrix, you can ask Unity for that with the following:

```csharp
LayerMask myLayerMask = Physics2D.GetLayerCollisionMask(gameObject.layer);
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a temp collider list?</summary>

For performance reasons, the OverlapCollider method from Unity takes an array and then adds data to it, as opposed to returning an array with the data requested (as they do for calls such as GetComponents).  They do this because calls like this may occur frequently, and the overhead of creating a new array each time may become a bottleneck.

We create the array once and then pass the same one every time we make the call to OverlapCollider.

For this component, we don't actually need the data itself.  We only want to know if any objects overlap or not.  For this reason, we never read anything from the tempColliderList; we only consider the number of results (the return value for that method).

Unity also uses the array we pass in to define the max number of results it should discover.  That is why our temp array has a length of 1 and not 0.

## 5.4) Fade in Entities

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/HoverGuyDontSpawn.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/HoverGuyFade.zip)

Add a script to entities so that they fade in before moving.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create FadeInThenEnable**:

 - Create script Code/Effects/**[FadeInThenEnable](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/blob/HoverGuyFade/Assets/Code/Effects/FadeInThenEnable.cs)**:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class FadeInThenEnable : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float timeTillEnabled = 3;

  [SerializeField]
  Behaviour[] componentsToEnable;

  protected void OnEnable()
  {
    StartCoroutine(FadeIn());
  }

  protected void OnDisable()
  {
    StopAllCoroutines();
  }

  IEnumerator FadeIn()
  {
    SpriteRenderer[] spriteList
      = gameObject.GetComponentsInChildren<SpriteRenderer>();

    float timePassed = 0;
    while(timePassed < timeTillEnabled)
    {
      float percentComplete = timePassed / timeTillEnabled;
      SetAlpha(spriteList, percentComplete * percentComplete);

      yield return null;

      timePassed += Time.deltaTime;
    }

    SetAlpha(spriteList, 1);

    for(int i = 0; i < componentsToEnable.Length; i++)
    {
      Behaviour component = componentsToEnable[i];
      component.enabled = true;
    }
  }

  void SetAlpha(
    SpriteRenderer[] spriteList,
    float alpha)
  {
    for(int i = 0; i < spriteList.Length; i++)
    {
      SpriteRenderer sprite = spriteList[i];
      Color originalColor = sprite.color;
      sprite.color = new Color(
        originalColor.r,
        originalColor.g,
        originalColor.b,
        alpha);
    }
  }
}
```

<br>**Configure Character**:

 - Select the Character and disable the PlayerController component.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z0s9bXJ.png" width=300px />

 - Add **FadeInThenEnable**:
   - Expand 'Components to Enable'.
     - Size 2
       - Tab or click away to get the list to refresh.
     - Drag/drop the PlayerController into the list as 'Element 0'.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yzsppid.gif" width=300px />


 - Select the Character's sprite:
   - Disable the Animator component.
   - Update the SpriteRenderer's Sprite to the initial stance.  We are using **adventurer_stand**.
 - Add the Animator into the Components to Enable Element 1:
    - Open a second Inspector by right clicking on the Inspector tab and selecting Add Tab -> Inspector.
    - Select a GameObject of interest and hit the lock symbol in one of the Inspectors.
    - Select the other GameObject and then drag the Animator from one Inspector into the other.
 - Unlock the second Inspector and/or close the tab.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DBOp8Vj.gif" width=300px />


<br>**Configure HoverGuy**:

 - Select the HoverGuy's sprite:
    - Disable the Animator.
    - Update the Sprite to the initial stance.  We are using **flyguy_stand**.
 - Select the HoverGuy prefab and disable the WanderWalkController.
   - Add **FadeInThenEnable**:
     - Assign WanderWalkController and the Animator to the Components to Enable list.

<br>**Test**:

 - The Character should fade in when you hit play.  While fading, you should not be able to move.
 - Every HoverGuy that spawns in should fade in before walking.

<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

using clauses at the top of a file brings APIs into scope. Used for:

 - System.Collections.IEnumerator
 - UnityEngine.Behaviour
 - UnityEngine.Color
 - UnityEngine.Debug
 - UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour
 - UnityEngine.SerializeFieldAttribute
 - UnityEngine.SpriteRenderer

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
```

We inherit from MonoBehaviour, which allows this script to be added as a component on a GameObject.

public is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
public class FadeInThenEnable : MonoBehaviour
{
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute that exposes a field in the Inspector, allowing you to configure it for the object.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
```

This is the amount of time to fade the sprites for.  When the fade completes, a list of components will be enabled.  You can change the default value here in the Inspector.

```csharp
  float timeTillEnabled = 3;
```

This is a list of components to enable when the fade completes.  This list may be left empty, allowing you to use FadeInThenEnable as just a fade in script.  Set in the Inspector.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  Behaviour[] componentsToEnable;
```

OnEnable is a Unity event which is called anytime this component or GameObject is enabled.

protected is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void OnEnable()
  {
```

This starts the coroutine below.

```csharp
    StartCoroutine(FadeIn());
  }
```

OnDisable is called anytime this component or GameObject is disabled or destroyed.

protected is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void OnDisable()
  {
```

This terminates all coroutines started by this script, if any are still running.

```csharp
    StopAllCoroutines();
  }
```

This is the coroutine to fade the sprite, and then enable a list of components.

```csharp
  IEnumerator FadeIn()
  {
```

Here we get a reference to all of the sprites on this GameObject and its children.

```csharp
    SpriteRenderer[] spriteList
      = gameObject.GetComponentsInChildren<SpriteRenderer>();
```

Loop until the requested duration for the fade has completed.

```csharp
    float timePassed = 0;
    while(timePassed < timeTillEnabled)
    {
```

Here we calculate the progress of the fade, in the range 0 to 1.

```csharp
      float percentComplete = timePassed / timeTillEnabled;
```

This calls a helper method below to change the alpha on each of the sprites.  The alpha value we are using here is percent complete squared, still in the range 0 to 1 but it will fade slower in the beginning.

```csharp
      SetAlpha(spriteList, percentComplete * percentComplete);
```

Here we wait until the next frame.

```csharp
      yield return null;
```

Here we track how long this coroutine has been running by adding the length of the previous frame.

```csharp
      timePassed += Time.deltaTime;
    }
```

When the fade is complete, this ensures that the final alpha value is 1.

```csharp
    SetAlpha(spriteList, 1);
```

Here we loop over each of the components that should be enabled.

```csharp
    for(int i = 0; i < componentsToEnable.Length; i++)
    {
```

This enables each component.

```csharp
      Behaviour component = componentsToEnable[i];
      component.enabled = true;
    }
  }
```

This is a helper method to change the alpha value for an array of sprites.

```csharp
  void SetAlpha(
    SpriteRenderer[] spriteList,
    float alpha)
  {
```

Here we loop over each of the sprites.

```csharp
    for(int i = 0; i < spriteList.Length; i++)
    {
```

This sets the color of the sprite to its original color, but with the alpha value specified.

```csharp
      SpriteRenderer sprite = spriteList[i];

      Color originalColor = sprite.color;
      sprite.color = new Color(
        originalColor.r,
        originalColor.g,
        originalColor.b,
        alpha);
    }
  }
}
```

</details>
<details><summary>What does StopAllCoroutines do?</summary>

StopAllCoroutines will stop any coroutines which were started by this script.  Coroutines in Unity are not running on a different thread, so nothing will be interrupted in that sense; however, any coroutine which has yield returned and is expecting to be resumed will not be.

Coroutines are automatically stopped when a GameObject is Destroyed or SetActive(false) is called.  However, disabling a component (and not the entire GameObject) does not automatically stop coroutines, which is why we do it explicitly with OnDisable here.

<details><summary>What's Behaviour and how does it differ from MonoBehaviour?</summary>

MonoBehaviour inherits from Behaviour.  And Behaviour inherits from Component, which inherits from UnityEngine.Object.

MonoBehaviour is the base that we use for custom scripts / components that we create for GameObjects.  Behaviour is a more generalized version that Unity uses for some components, such as the Animator.

For the FadeInThenEnable script, we are only interested in the ability to 'enable', which is added with Behaviour.  By using Behaviour instead of MonoBehaviour, this script is compatible with more components, such as the Animator.
