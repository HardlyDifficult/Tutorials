## 3.1) Create a Ball with Gravity

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_6_Organize.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_1_CreateBall.zip)

Add a GameObject for the SpikeBall, set the sprite's order in layer, and add a rigidbody.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create SpikeBall**:

 - Add the sprite to the scene.  We are using Art/jumperpack_kenney/PNG/Enemies/**spikeBall1**
 - Create a parent GameObject:
   - Create an empty GameObject named "SpikeBall".
   - Drag and drop the sprite into SpikeBall.
   - Set the sprite's position to 0.

<br>**Update Order in Layer**:

 - Select the SpikeBall's sprite:
   - Order in Layer: -10

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xYjw6yS.png" width=300px />

<br>**Add a rigidbody**:

 - Select the SpikeBall's parent:
   - Add a **Rigidbody2D** component.

<br>**Test**:

At this point you should be hitting play after almost every step to confirm things are working and better understand what is happening.

 - Hit play: the SpikeBall should fall through platforms and out of view.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PuWWL3z.gif" width=50px />

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What does Order in Layer do?</summary>

When multiple sprites are overlapping, Order in Layer is used to determine which one is on top of the other.  So if the SpikeBall sprite has Order in Layer '-10', and everything else uses the default Order in Layer '0', the SpikeBall will always appear behind of the other sprites in the world.

Order in Layer may be any int value, positive or negative. Here's an example showing the character sprite we will be using with Order in Layer '-1' and with '2', sitting on a platform which still has the default Order in Layer '0'.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QCHPLDf.png" width=150px />

We use -10 instead of -1 so that there is space for additional layers we may not have planned for yet.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use a parent here?</summary>

For consistency.

In this tutorial, we will encounter use cases which warrant using a parent GameObject with the sprite in a child: for the character and one enemy type.  For the mechanics we plan to implement, the SpikeBall will work with or without the sprite in a child GameObject.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a Rigidbody2D?</summary>

A rigidbody is a core component for the Unity physics engine. Rigidbody2D is the 2D version of this component (vs 3D).  It's added to GameObjects which may be manipulated by physics during the game, for example:

 - Falling with gravity.
 - Moving with forces such as velocity.
 - Reacting to collisions with other objects.

<hr></details>

## 3.2) Add a Collider

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_1_CreateBall.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_2_Collider.zip)

Add a circle collider to the SpikeBall.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Add a circle collider**:

 - Select the SpikeBall's parent
   - Add **CircleCollider2D**:
     - Radius: .65

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/crXdz35.gif" width=300px />

<br>**Test**:

 - Hit play: the ball should land on a platform and, if it's slanted, roll down.
   - Move the SpikeBall's parent to test falling down each platform.
   - Adjust the spacing between platforms as needed.
   - Note that some may roll off the sides - we'll fix that next.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Why size the collider smaller than the ball?</summary>

It's optional; use whatever you think creates the best experience.

The circle collider allows the ball to roll.  Place the ball at the top of a slanted platform and gravity will get things moving.

Hit play to watch the SpikeBall fall onto a platform and roll:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/x4a848N.gif" width=300px />

If the ball gets stuck while testing because some platforms are too close, update the platform position or rotation.

I'm suggesting that we size the collider slightly smaller than the ball itself. This will cause the SpikeBall to roll on its body with the spikes digging into platforms instead of rolling on the tips of each spike as shown here:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ov1F5Fo.gif" width=150px />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WRLQITb.gif" width=150px />

On a related note, setting the 'Order in Layer' to '-1' ensures that the spikes are behind the platform.  Without this, the spikes would be on top:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8cgB7jZ.gif" width=150px />

<hr></details>


## 3.3) Add Invisible Bumpers

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_2_Collider.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_3_Bumpers.zip)

Add additional box colliders off-screen to redirect balls back on-screen.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create a bumper**:

 - Create an Empty GameObject named "Bumper".
   - Add **BoxCollider2D**.
     - Size X: 20

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3ca7cy3.png" width=300px>

<br>**Layout bumpers**:

 - Rotate for a steep incline:
   - Use the Rotate tool and adjust the Z rotation to about 30 (or -30).
 - Move the Bumper so that the edge overlaps the platform but stays entirely outside the visible screen region.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AGjCZTw.png" width=300px />

 - Repeat for each platform.
   - Copy and paste the bumper, then modify its position and rotation.
   - We do not want a bumper for the bottom left, as balls should not return after that point.

 Your screen with bumpers should look something like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YTOiAjD.png" width=300px />

<br>**Organize hierarchy**:

 - Create a new parent "Bumpers":
   - Set the position to 0.
   - Select all the Bumper GameObjects and drag / drop them into Bumpers.

<br>**Test**:

 - Position the ball on a steep platform and confirm that it uses the bumper and returns.

<hr></details><br>

<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

With this level design, SpikeBalls will roll right off the edge of the screen.  Instead of making them bounce off the screen's edge (as we will for other entities later), we wanted to allow the SpikeBalls to go off-screen but then return shortly after.

The bumpers we added extend the platforms so that the balls don't fall off completely, but also accelerates the balls' return to the world.

Hit play. The SpikeBall should hit the bumper and quickly reverse, then accelerate in the other direction:

<hr></details>

## 3.4) Spawn Balls

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_3_Bumpers.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_4_Spawn.zip)

Add the EvilCloud and create a script for it to spawn SpikeBalls.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create an EvilCloud**:

 - Add the sprite to the scene.  We are using Art\jumperpack_kenney\PNG\Enemies\\**Cloud**
 - Create a parent GameObject named "EvilCloud".
   - Drag and drop the sprite in.
   - Set the sprite's position to 0.
 - Move EvilCloud to the top left.
 - Use the Scale tool to scale up a bit.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MZWguje.png" width=150px />
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kK9dKcD.gif" width=300px />

<br>**Create a prefab**:

 - Create directory Assets/Prefabs.
 - Select the SpikeBall and click/drag it to the Assets/Prefabs folder.
 - Delete the GameObject.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/roE0SWK.gif" width=300px />

<br>**Create a spawner**:

 - Create script Code/Controllers/**Spawner**:
   - [Full version](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/blob/3_4_Spawn/Assets/Code/Controllers/Spawner.cs) with comments and asserts.

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class Spawner : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  GameObject thingToSpawn;

  [SerializeField]
  float minTimeBetweenSpawns = .5f;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenSpawns = 10;

  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(SpawnEnemiesCoroutine());
  }

  IEnumerator SpawnEnemiesCoroutine()
  {
    while(true)
    {
      Instantiate(
        thingToSpawn,
        transform.position,
        Quaternion.identity);

      float sleepTime = UnityEngine.Random.Range(
        minTimeBetweenSpawns,
        maxTimeBetweenSpawns);
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(sleepTime);
    }
  }
}
```

<br>**Configure spawner**:

 - Add **Spawner** to the EvilCloud:
   - Confirm that the values for the component match the defaults in code.
   - Thing To Spawn: SpikeBall

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/scu8YUR.gif" width=300px />

<br>**Test**:

 - SpikeBalls should be spawning from the cloud periodically.
   - Since the platform is flat, they may simply stack up for now.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

'using' clauses at the top of a file brings APIs into scope.  Used for:

 - System.Collections.IEnumerator
 - UnityEngine.Collider2D
 - UnityEngine.ContactFilter2D
 - UnityEngine.Debug
 - UnityEngine.GameObject
 - UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour
 - UnityEngine.Quaternion
 - UnityEngine.SerializeFieldAttribute
 - UnityEngine.WaitForSeconds

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
```

We inherit from MonoBehaviour, which allows this script to be added as a component on a GameObject. 

public is optional here.  Used for consistency.

```csharp
public class Spawner : MonoBehaviour
{
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute that exposes a field in the Inspector, allowing you to configure it for the object.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
```

This holds a reference to the prefab which will be instantiated by this spawner, set in the Inspector.

```csharp
  GameObject thingToSpawn;
```
  
After spawning a GameObject, this script will wait a random amount of time.  These values may be changed in the Inspector, allowing you to modify how frequently spawns happen.  

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  float minTimeBetweenSpawns = .5f;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxTimeBetweenSpawns = 10;
```

Start is a Unity event which is called once for a component, the first time it is enabled.

protected is optional here.  Used for consistency (explained more in the questions below).

```csharp
  protected void Start()
  {
```

This starts the coroutine below.

```csharp
    StartCoroutine(SpawnEnemiesCoroutine());
  }
```

This is coroutine which will periodically spawn a GameObject.

```csharp
  IEnumerator SpawnEnemiesCoroutine()
  {
```

This coroutine will loop forever.  The only way to stop this is to stop the coroutine, either by calling an API to stop it or by destroying or disabling this GameObject.

```csharp
    while(true)
    {
```

This creates a copy of the prefab and places it in the world, at this GameObject's position and with no rotation.  

```csharp
      Instantiate(
        thingToSpawn,
        transform.position,
        Quaternion.identity);
```

Here we pick a random amount of time to sleep, between the min and max specified in the Inspector.

```csharp
      float sleepTime = UnityEngine.Random.Range(
        minTimeBetweenSpawns,
        maxTimeBetweenSpawns);
```

This will pause the coroutine for the time calculated above, and then we loop to spawn again.

```csharp
      yield return new WaitForSeconds(sleepTime);
    }
  }
}
```

</details>
<details><summary>What does changing scale Z do?</summary>

Nothing (for 2D games).  When we are scaling we only need to ensure X and Y scales match in order to not distort the art.  Z could be left at the default of 1, but I prefer to keep it in sync with X and Y as well, as Unity's scale tool will do this by default.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a prefab?</summary>

A prefab is a file representing a configured GameObject.  This includes any child GameObjects as well as Components and their settings from the Inspector.

This allows things like our spawner to instantiate a GameObject with the appropriate components and configurations without knowing any details about the specific object type it is spawning.  More [on prefabs from Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html).

When you modify a prefab, all the objects in the world automatically get updated as well.  If you prefer to work with GameObjects in the scene, you can modify any one GameObject and then click 'Apply' to save the changes to the prefab.

You can also override values from the prefab to create a unique object in the scene.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's MonoBehaviour / how is Start called?</summary>

Most of the scripts that you create in Unity will derive from MonoBehaviour.  [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) is the base class for a GameObject component (scripts on objects in your world).  It allows you to execute logic every Update (each frame) and respond to collision events, etc.

There are a lot of events available to MonoBehaviours.  In this example we are using Start which is called once per object, when that object is first spawned in the world.

Note that when implementing MonoBehaviour events, you neither use 'override' nor subscribe to the event.  Instead, Unity uses reflection based on the method signature to improve performance.  This creates an unintuitive pattern for C# developers but allows Unity to eliminate unnecessary calls.  In development, this optimization would normally be considered overkill; however, for a game engine, this kind of thing adds up, particularly since there are typically hundreds of MonoBehaviours in the world.

See also [Unity's Execution Order of Event Functions](
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html).

<hr></details>

<details><summary>What's SerializeField and why not use public instead?</summary>

[SerializeField] exposes the object's field (data) in the 'Inspector' window.  The default value seen in the C# script becomes the default in the Inspector; however, when the script runs, the value is whatever you set for that object in the Inspector. This allows you to change values per object or have different values for a component which is used on various different object types.  You can also change values in the Inspector at runtime, which can be helpful while debugging.

Read [more about Serialization in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Serialization.html).

Any public field is a SerializeField by default.  If you do not want a public field to be exposed in the inspector, you can add the [HideInInspector] attribute (from the System namespace).

So why not just use public instead of [SerializeField]?

The fields in question are often only leveraged inside the component itself.  Other components may not interact with these fields directly.  In those scenarios, I prefer to follow the Object-Oriented programming best practice of [data encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)), meaning we only expose public fields when we want other classes to interact with them.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why use protected on the Unity event?</summary>

Protected is an access modifier in C# which ensures that the only way to call that method or field is from the same class, or from a class which derives from it.  Unity will find events such as Update() based on the signature, ignoring the access modifier and allowing you to use anything you'd like.

Why protected and not private?

When you are using inheritance and both the child and parent classes need to include an event such as Update(), Unity will only call the child's implementation.  This can make it easy to miss that some events in the parent class have been overwritten (vs complemented by) the child.

I recommend using protected on every Unity event so that the compiler can help avoid this mistake.  In the event the parent and child classes both have protected Update(), you will get a compile warning about the conflict.

If you want both child and parent called, change the methods as follows:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Test : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected virtual void Update()
  {
    // Parent update logic
  }
}

public class AChildOfTest : Test
{
  protected override void Update()
  {
    base.Update();
    // Child update logic to run after the parent's Update
  }
}
```

If you want the child to replace the parent's Update method (so that the parent's Update is never called), change the method like so:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Test : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void Update()
  {
    // Parent update logic
  }
}

public class AChildOfTest : Test
{
  protected new void Update()
  {
    // Child update logic to be run instead of the parent's Update
  }
}
```

What if it's not a parent class?

I recommend always using protected on Unity events.  A class may not be a parent at the moment, but code constantly changes and matures.  This is a best practice to help avoid potential issues in the future.  If the class never becomes a parent, the method is effectively treated as private.  There is no performance or other runtime impact from using protected.

Why not always make the methods virtual?

Performance.  There is a runtime cost to marking a method as virtual, even if there are no overrides.

Why not public instead?

Encapsulation.  If we were to make these methods public, it suggests that other components may call the events directly.  I've yet to encounter a use case where it's appropriate to do that - you should rely only on Unity to call these events to keep your code clean.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's StartCoroutine / WaitForSeconds?</summary>

A Coroutine allows you to define a sequence which takes more than a single frame to execute.  It's implemented with a C# enumerator, which Unity will then execute over time.  For example:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void Start()
  {
    StartCoroutine(ExampleCoroutine());
  }

  IEnumerator ExampleCoroutine()
  {
    print("Launch in T minus 3 seconds");
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(1);
    print("Launch in T minus 2 seconds");
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(1);
    print("Launch in T minus 1 seconds");
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(.75f);
    print("Almost there!");
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(.25f);
    print("Go go go");
  }
}
```

When StartCoroutine is called, the first line ("Launch in T minus 3 seconds") is printed immediately.  Then we 'yield return' the amount of time until the next line should be executed.

'yield' before the return is a special C# keyword used with enumerators.  It is marking your location in the method, allowing another class (in this example, Unity's internal logic), to resume the method from where it left off.

WaitForSeconds is a Unity class used to define the amount of time before the enumerator should be resumed.  There are similar classes available to give you more control over when the Coroutine is resumed: WaitForSecondsRealtime, WaitForEndOfFrame, WaitForFixedUpdate, WaitUntil, and WaitWhile.

Coroutines may be canceled before it's complete by calling StopCoroutine or StopAllCoroutines.  When a GameObject is destroyed, any Coroutines it had started are stopped.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does Instantiate do?</summary>

Instantiate clones a GameObject or prefab, creating a new GameObject in the scene.  There are a few variations of the call you can use.

To clone using the original's Transform (position, rotation, scale):
```csharp
Instantiate(thingToSpawn);
```

To clone and set a position and rotation:
```csharp
Instantiate(thingToSpawn, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);
```

To clone and set a parent for this GameObject:

```csharp
Instantiate(thingToSpawn, gameObject);
```

<hr></details>

<details><summary>What's a Quaternion?</summary>

A Quaternion is how rotations are stored in a game engine.  They represent the rotation with (x, y, z, w) values.  The values are stored in this fashion because it is an efficient way to do the necessary calculations when rendering on object on-screen.  Quaternion.identity is the default (0) rotation for a sprite.

You could argue that this is overkill for a 2D game, as in 2D the only rotation that may be applied is around the Z axis, and I would agree.  However, remember that Unity is a 3D game engine.  When creating a 2D game, you are still in a 3D environment.  Therefore, under the hood, Unity still optimizes its data for 3D.

Quaternions are not easy for people to understand.  When we think of rotations, we typically think in terms of 'Euler' (pronounced oil-er) rotations.  Euler rotations are degrees of rotation around each axis; e.g., (0, 0, 30) means "rotate the object by 30 degrees around the Z axis."

In the inspector, modifying a Transform's rotation is done in Euler.  In code, you can either work with Quaternions directly, or use Euler and then convert it back to Quaternion for storage.

Given a Quaternion, you can calculate the Euler value like so:

```csharp
Quaternion myRotationInQuaternion = transform.rotation;
Vector3 myRotationInEuler = myRotationInQuaternion.eulerAngles;
```

Given an Euler value, you can calculate the Quaternion:

```csharp
Quaternion rotationOfZ30Degrees = Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 30);
```

Quaternions may be combined using Quaternion multiplication:

```csharp
Quaternion rotationOfZ60Degrees
  = rotationOfZ30Degrees * rotationOfZ30Degrees;
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does Random.Range do / what other options do we have for RNG?</summary>

Unity provides a convenient static class for getting random data.  For example:

```csharp
float randomNumber0To1 = UnityEngine.Random.value;
float randomNumberNeg10p5ToPos5 = UnityEngine.Random.Range(-10.5f, 5f);
Quaternion randomRotation = UnityEngine.Random.rotation;
```

How is [UnityEngine.Random](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Random.html) different from System.Random?

In addition to providing APIs which are convenient for games (such as .rotation), the UnityEngine.Random is accessed statically, while the System.Random requires you to create an object first.

Since the Unity random class has the same name as the System random class, I try to consistently use the fully qualified name like this:

```csharp
UnityEngine.Random.Range(-1f, 1f);
```

The reason being, if you have 'using System' in the file, the compiler may throw an error.  For example:

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void Start()
  {
    // This line is a compile error
    float randomNumber = Random.Range(-1f, 1f);

    // This line works correctly
    float randomNumber = UnityEngine.Random.Range(-1f, 1f);
  }
}
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Does the filename matter?</summary>

Yes!

This is unusual for C# developers, but yes, the filename must match the class name in order for Unity to work correctly.  If the names don't match, everything will compile, but the script will not be selectable as a component.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why confirm the values in the Inspector match the defaults in code?</summary>

When a script runs, it uses the values as defined in the Inspector, which may be different than the defaults in code.  Usually, Unity will default all the fields in the Inspector to the defaults you have written in code.  However, depending on the exact order in which you do things, this may not always work out.  If you create a script and it does not function properly, double check the values in the Inspector.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does Debug.Assert do?</summary>

The full version of the code we link to in this tutorial includes Debug.Assert statements where appropriate.

Debug.Assert is used to confirm an assumption your code is making.  If the assumption does not hold (i.e., if the contents of the Debug.Assert evaluate to false), then the assert fails and an error is presented in the Unity console for you to investigate.

```csharp
Debug.Assert(confirmThisIsTrue);
```

Optionally, you can include a message to be displayed when the assert fails.  e.g.:

```csharp
Debug.Assert(confirmThisIsTrue, "confirmThisIsTrue must be true");
```

Debug.Assert is there to help more quickly identify problems.  If the assert fails, it does not prevent other code from being executed; however, you can select 'Error Pause' in the 'Console' to better see what is happening at that moment.

Debug.Assert does not execute in release / the built version of your game.  In other words, including these checks does not result in a performance impact to the final game.

A common use case for Debug.Assert is to validate pre-conditions and post-conditions.

 - Pre-conditions are assumptions which should be true when entering a method.
 - Post-conditions should hold true when exiting.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why does ReSharper recommend changing variables to readonly?</summary>

The recommendation to change to readonly will not work.

ReSharper is recommending this because there appears to be a private variable which never changes.  However, it does not understand what SerializeField is doing.  SerializeField exposes the property in the Inspector, allowing you to change the value at any time (useful while debugging).

## 3.5) Add Initial Momentum

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_4_Spawn.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_5_Init.zip)

Add a script to the SpikeBall which sets an initial velocity and angular velocity.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create InitializeRigidbody**:

 - Create script Code/Movement/**[InitializeRigidbody](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/blob/3_5_Init/Assets/Code/Movement/InitializeRigidbody.cs)**:

 ```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D))]
public class InitializeRigidbody : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  Vector2 startingVelocity = new Vector2(3, 0);

  [SerializeField]
  float startingAngularVelocity = -500;

  protected void Start()
  {
    Rigidbody2D myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();

    myBody.velocity = startingVelocity;
    myBody.angularVelocity = startingAngularVelocity;
  }
}
```

<br>**Add to the SpikeBall**:

 - Select Assets/Prefabs/SpikeBall:
   - Add **InitializeRigidbody**.
     - Confirm the values in the Inspector match defaults written in code.

<br>**Test**:

 - Balls should fall out of the cloud and travel to the right at first, then roll down all of the platforms.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

'using' clauses at the top of a file brings APIs into scope.  Used for:

 - UnityEngine.Debug
 - UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour
 - UnityEngine.RequireComponentAttribute
 - UnityEngine.Rigidbody2D
 - UnityEngine.SerializeFieldAttribute
 - UnityEngine.Vector2

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute which informs the editor that this script requires a Rigidbody2D component on the GameObject.  

```csharp
[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D))]
```

We inherit from MonoBehaviour, which allows this script to be added as a component on a GameObject. 

public is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
public class InitializeRigidbody : MonoBehaviour
{
```

This is a Unity-specific attribute that exposes a field in the Inspector, allowing you to configure it for the object.

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
```

This is the initial velocity to give to the rigidbody when the GameObject is spawned.  The default value here may be changed in the Inspector. 

```csharp
  Vector2 startingVelocity = new Vector2(3, 0);
```

This is the initial spin to add to the rigidbody, set in the Inspector.  

```csharp
  [SerializeField]
  float startingAngularVelocity = -500;
```

Start is a Unity event which is called once for a component, the first time it is enabled.

protected is optional here.  Used for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void Start()
  {
```

Here we get a reference to the rigidbody on this GameObject.

```csharp
    Rigidbody2D myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
```

When the GameObject is first spawned, here we set the initial momentum values configured in the Inspector on the rigidbody.

```csharp
    myBody.velocity = startingVelocity;
    myBody.angularVelocity = startingAngularVelocity;
  }
}

<details><summary>What are velocity and angularVelocity?</summary>

A GameObject with a rigidbody may be moved with forces.  The Unity Physics engine uses these forces as inputs in order to calculate the object's position and rotation, considering other things in the world such as a wall blocking your path.

Unity follows [Newton's Laws of Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion) - e.g., an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a force.

There are various APIs for manipulating forces on a rigidbody.  This script will be setting initial values for:

 - Velocity: the direction and speed of movement. Absent any additional forces, 'Drag' decreases the velocity every frame until it reaches 0.
 - Angular velocity: degrees per second to rotate the object.  Absent any additional forces, 'Angular drag' will decrease this until it reaches 0.

<details><summary>What's a Vector2 and how does it differ from Vector3?</summary>

A Vector2 is a struct which holds 2 floats: X, Y.  A Vector3 holds 3 floats: X, Y, Z.  It has an API helpful for managing positions and directions, including:

 - .magnitude: Returns the length of a line drawn from the origin to this position.
 - .normalized: Returns a new Vector2 representing the same direction but with a magnitude of 1.

For 2D games, we often refer to position and direction as a Vector2.  Unity still stores everything as Vector3, and allows you to easily convert from one to another.

<details><summary>What does GetComponent do / what's C# generics?</summary>

GetComponent is used to find another script/component on a GameObject by its type.  If you need to access a script multiple times, it's generally better to call GetComponent just once (typically in Awake) and cache the results.

There are similar APIs available from Unity, such as GetComponentsInChildren, which are used to discover multiple components and/or search more GameObjects.

In C#, generics are a way of passing a Type to another method or class.  In this example, we pass the type of component we are looking for to GetComponent.  The benefit / difference from passing the type using a Type object (e.g., typeof(MyClass)) is that the type can be used statically.  For example, these two lines return the same result, but generics has a cleaner syntax:

```csharp
Rigidbody2D myBody = (Rigidbody2D)GetComponent(typeof(Rigidbody2D));
Rigidbody2D myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
```

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does RequireComponent do?</summary>

[RequireComponent] is a Unity attribute used to let the editor know that this component requires another component on the same GameObject.

```csharp
[RequireComponent(typeof(ComponentThatMustBeOnThisGameObject))]
public class MyComponent ...
```

When you add a component in the inspector which requires another, and the required component is not already on that GameObject, Unity will automatically add it for you.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not use a "SpikeBall" component instead?</summary>

You could, but...

Unity encourages component-based solutions, where you aim to offer a single mechanic per component.  Here's a good [Wikipedia article on component-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering) design.  Briefly, the advantages to this approach are:

 - Each script or component focuses on a single feature or mechanic, simplifying it and making it easier to debug.
 - Components may be reused between different object types.  If we had one master SpikeBall component and then created a similar enemy with a few different mechanics, reusing logic would be more challenging, and we might instead just copy/paste parts to our new enemy component making maintaining and debugging this logic harder in the future.

Create a layer for enemies and update the collision matrix to disable enemy-to-enemy collisions.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create a layer**:

 - Open menu Edit -> Project Settings -> Tags and Layers.
   - Under 'Layers' add "Enemy".

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/spZG3NZ.png" width=300px />

<br>**Configure SpikeBall**:

 - Select Assets/Prefabs/SpikeBall:
   - Click the dropdown next to 'Layer' and select Enemy.
     - Select 'No, this object only' when prompted.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KPvq22a.png" width=300px />

<br>**Configure collision matrix**:

 - Edit -> Project Settings -> Physics 2D, under the 'Layer Collision Matrix':
   - Uncheck the box where 'Enemy' meets 'Enemy'.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JkjXpZN.png" width=300px />

<br>**Test**:

 - Balls should now freely pass through each other, but still collide with platforms as expected.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What's a Layer and how's it different from a Tag?</summary>

Layers are a way of categorizing GameObjects.  By disabling enemy/enemy in the collision matrix, enemies can no longer collide with other enemies. They will walk through each other as if the other did not exist.

A Layer is an int representing a category or type of object in your game.  The Unity editor allows you to associate a string with this value as well for convenience.  A LayerMask is an int representing multiple Layers.

LayerMasks can be used to efficiently include or exclude objects based off of their type.  For this reason, the physics matrix in Unity works with Layers.

To determine if a Layer is included within a LayerMask, use the following example.  Comparing to a LayerMask uses 'bit shifting' and a 'bitwise and', which are not intuitive.  Later in the tutorial, we'll create an extension method so we don't ever have to look at this again.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class MyComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void Start()
  {
    LayerMask mask = LayerMask.GetMask(new[] { "Water", "UI" });
    if((mask.value & 1 << gameObject.layer) > 0)
    {
      // This gameObject is included in the LayerMask
    }
    else
    {
      // This gameObject is NOT in the LayerMask
    }
  }
}
```

A tag is also a way of categorizing objects, but by string.  It's useful for more targeted use cases, such as identifying the MainCamera and the Player.

To check the tag, use CompareTag as shown here:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class MyComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void Start()
  {
    if(gameObject.CompareTag("Player"))
    {
      // This gameObject is a Player
    }
    else
    {
      // This gameObject is NOT a Player
    }
  }
}
```

Every GameObject has both one layer and one tag.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What does the collision matrix impact?</summary>

The collision matrix defines which GameObjects may collide with what other GameObjects, based on the GameObjects' layers.

A checked box indicates that collisions are supported.  Uncheck to disable collisions between those layers.  When unchecked, collisions between GameObjects in those layers are completely disabled, allowing objects to pass through each other as if the other didn't exist.

Every possible combination of layers is exposed as a checkbox in settings, including a layer coming in contact with itself.  Remember that layers are defining a category or object type, so by disabling the 'Enemy' layer from coming in contact with itself, we are preventing one ball from colliding with another in the world while still allowing them to roll over platforms.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not change the children layers too?</summary>

You could it will work fine here either way.

As a general best practice, I suggest always selecting 'No, this object only'.  The reason for this is later in the tutorial we will have child GameObjects which must use a different layer than their parent.

## 3.7) Destroy Balls that Roll Off

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_6_Disable.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/3_7_Destroy.zip)

Add a script to the SpikeBall that destroys the GameObject after it rolls off the bottom platform and out of view.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create DestroyOutOfBounds**:

 - Create script Code/Death/**[DestroyOutOfBounds](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/blob/3_7_Destroy/Assets/Code/Death/DestroyOutOfBounds.cs)**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class DestroyOutOfBounds : MonoBehaviour
{
  const float outOfBoundsYPosition = -12;

  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
    if(transform.position.y < outOfBoundsYPosition)
    {
      Destroy(gameObject);
    }
  }
}
```

<br>**Configure SpikeBall**:

 - Select SpikeBall:
   - Add **DestroyOutOfBounds**.

<br>**Test**:

 - Balls should now destroy themselves after falling off-screen.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>

'using' clauses at the top of a file brings APIs into scope. Used for:

 - UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
```

We inherit from MonoBehaviour, which allows this script to be added as a component on a GameObject.

public is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
public class DestroyOutOfBounds : MonoBehaviour
{
```

This is a value which never changes, representing a position at which we can assume objects are below the visible world and may safely be destroyed.

```csharp
  const float outOfBoundsYPosition = -12;
```

FixedUpdate is a Unity event which is called every x ms of game time, until disabled or destroyed.

protected is optional here. Used for consistency.

```csharp
  protected void FixedUpdate()
  {
```

Here we check if this GameObject's position is below the visible world.

```csharp
    if(transform.position.y < outOfBoundsYPosition)
    {
```

This destroys this GameObject, removing it and any children GameObjects from the scene.

```csharp
      Destroy(gameObject);
    }
  }
}
```

</details>
<details><summary>Why hardcode the outOfBoundsYPosition?</summary>

DestroyOutOfBounds will destroy the GameObject when it goes below -12, which is a bit lower than the lowest the camera can see.

We hardcoded the value to keep things simple at the beginning of this tutorial.  Since the camera is fixed, this will work fine.

This script would work the same way without a fixed aspect ratio, since different aspect ratios only impact how much of the world we see horizontally.  If we supported a moving camera, we might need to calculate the kill height differently.

Later, we create a GameController which includes screenBounds, defining the area of the world that the camera can see.  DestroyOutOfBounds could switch to leverage that, allowing it to work correctly with different camera sizes.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why bother if the GameObject is already off-screen?</summary>

When a GameObject is off-screen there is no attempt to render it, so your GPU is not wasting time. However, Unity is still processing Physics and logic for any components on the GameObject.  In this case, once the GameObject has fallen off the bottom it will never return to the game.

We destroy it to save performance while the game is running.  Without this script, the endless stream of balls spawning and then falling off would be a 'memory leak'.  This means that you are wasting resources, and over time the performance of your game will get worse.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's Destroy and why not Destroy(this)?</summary>

Destroy is a Unity method to remove something from the scene.  You can:

 - Destroy a component, causing the component to be removed from that GameObject (and stopping future event calls such as Update).
 - Destroy a GameObject, causing that entire GameObject to be removed from the scene.

For example:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class MyComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
  public bool shouldThisComponentStop;
  public bool shouldThisGameObjectBeRemoved;

  protected void Update()
  {
    if(shouldThisComponentStop)
    {
      // Remove MyComponent from this GameObject
      Destroy(this);
    }
    if(shouldThisGameObjectBeRemoved)
    {
      // Destroy this entire GameObject from the scene
      Destroy(gameObject);
    }
  }
}
```

<details><summary>What about an object pool?</summary>

An object pool is an optimization technique which may be appropriate to use, but for purposes of simplicity we are not implementing it here.  Additionally, the performance gain for a game like this would be negligible.

What is an object pool?

Instantiate (creating a new GameObject) is one of the most expensive calls you can make.  An object pool is the programming term for reusing objects instead of destroying and creating new ones.

For this example, instead of destroying a SpikeBall that falls off-screen, we could instead have it respawn at the top and go through the entire level again.

When should an object pool be used?

Objects which destroy and spawn again several times may warrant an object pool. There is overhead associated with having and using an object pool, so it is not recommended for absolutely everything.  For example, a boss which is going to surface once in a game may not be a good choice to include in an object pool.

How is an object pool implemented?

Basically, anytime we spawn a GameObject, we ask the object pool if there is one already available for us to reuse.  And where we would have destroyed a GameObject, we would instead use gameObject.SetActive(false) and add it to the object pool's list of available objects.

For more, see [Catlike Coding's Object Pool tutorial](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/object-pools/).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why FixedUpdate vs Update?</summary>

For this use case, either would work fine.

We are using FixedUpdate instead of Update since the rigidbody, which is doing the movement on the object, runs on FixedUpdate.

</details>

## To Review

<details><summary>Testing / debugging tips</summary>

 - Try adjusting the variables in Spawner to get a reasonable flow of enemies.
 - Try adjusting the initial momentum on the SpikeBall.
   - Consider adding randomness to these values as well.
 - Try adjusting the bumper position angles so balls return to the screen promptly / smoothly.
 - Cut a test build and try it outside of the Unity editor environment.
 - While testing (in play mode):
   - You can change values in the Inspector and they will not be saved.  This allows you to experiment with different values easily.
 - Use Project Settings -> Time 'Time Scale' to make everything move faster or slower.
