## 2.1) Add a Platform

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/01_06_AutoSave.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_1_Platform.zip)

Add a sprite to the scene representing the middle segment of a platform.  

<details open><summary>How</summary>

**Add a platform**:

 - Select all of the Platform assets.  We are using Art\platformer-pack-redux-360-assets\PNG\Ground\Stone\\*
   - Pixels Per Unit: 200
 - Click and drag the platform sprite you want to use into the Scene window. 
   - We are using Art\platformer-pack-redux-360-assets\PNG\Ground\Stone\\**stoneMid**.

<br>**Tile the width**:

 - In the Hierarchy window, select the 'stoneMid' GameObject.
 - In the Inspector, under the SpriteRenderer component:
   - Draw Mode: Tiled
   - New Size options appear: 
      - Width: 23.04

<details><summary>What are GameObject, Transform, and Component?</summary>

Everything you see and interact with in a game is driven by GameObjects.  Typically, a GameObject represents a single logical object in the world (e.g., a character).  It may be composed of child GameObjects, each responsible for part of the display and/or behavior. It may also hold various components.  

A component is a set of logic (i.e., code) which may be added to a GameObject, or child GameObject, and is exposed in the 'Inspector' window for the GameObject you have selected in the 'Hierarchy'.  A GameObject may have any number of components, and those components may be configured to customize the behavior for that specific object.  

Unity has a number of components available out of the box. We will be using several Unity components in this tutorial, and making many custom components as well.

A Transform component manages the GameObject's position, rotation, and scale.  Every GameObject, including child GameObjects, has a Transform. Occasionally, you will encounter a GameObject that has nothing rendered on-screen.  In these cases the Transform is often completely ignored, but may not be removed.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>What's a SpriteRenderer?</summary>

SpriteRenderer is a Unity component that renders a sprite on-screen.  When we drag-and-dropped the sprite, a GameObject was created with a SpriteRenderer component automatically added.

Select the GameObject in the 'Hierarchy' to view the SpriteRenderer component for this object in the 'Inspector'.  Here, several options are available for modifying how the sprite is rendered.  For example:

 - Sprite: This is the sprite image to render.  It was populated automatically when you created the GameObject with drag/drop.
 - Color: White is the default, displaying the sprite as it was created by the artist.  Changing this color modifies the sprite's appearance.  You can also use the alpha value here to make a sprite transparent.

<hr></details>
TODO what does pixel per unit do?
<details><summary>What does tiling do, and why not use Transform scale?</summary>

Tiling causes a sprite to repeat as it gets larger, while Transform scale stretches the sprite.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ejbs3RK.png" width=300px />

We want to start with a platform that covers most of the screen.  When we attach edges to these platforms, we want patterns to line up.  If the width does not tile evenly, you may have only part of the pattern on the edges, making it harder to align with other platforms.

To avoid this issue, we scale by an even multiple of the original size.  This sprite's original size is .64.  We are using 16 times that (i.e., 23.04)

<hr></details>

## 2.2) Platform Edges

Create a new parent GameObject for the platform sprite and add edge sprites.

<details><summary>How</summary>

**Create a parent Platform**:

 - In the Hierarchy, right click and 'Create Empty'.
   - Rename to "Platform".
 - Drag and drop the sprite's GameObject (stoneMid) onto the Platform GameObject. 
   - Or drop it in the scene and rearrange. 
 
It should appear indented under Platform in the Hierarchy:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XEnuQnF.png" width=150px />

 - Change the child sprite's Transform to position (0, 0, 0).

<br>**Add rounded edges**:

 - Drag in the rounded edge sprites. 
   - We are using Art\platformer-pack-redux-360-assets\PNG\Ground\Stone\\**stoneLeft** and **Right**. 
 - Add them both to the parent Platform.
 - Select the move tool:
   - Move the edges away from the middle segment.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bYsJhjs.png" width=150px />

 - Use Vertex Snap to position the edge next to the main platform:
   - Hold V to enable Vertex Snap mode.
   - A box appears for each anchor point (e.g., the corners of the sprite).  Hover over one of the corners.
   - Click and drag the box.  The sprite should snap perfectly with other anchor points in the world.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/67vdU8b.gif" width=300px />

 - Repeat for both edges.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Why create a parent GameObject?</summary>

Most of the platforms we will be creating require multiple different sprites to display correctly.  We tackle this in the next section.  Even for platforms which are represented with a single sprite, it's nice to be consistent across all of our platforms.

The implications of using a parent GameObject will be clearer when we start to add game mechanics later in the tutorial.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>How is the sprite position calculated when it's a child?</summary>

When a GameObject is a child of another GameObject, its position, rotation, and scale are the combination of the child's Transform and the parent's Transform (via matrix multiplication).  

Typically, all Transform updates during the game and in level design are done to the parent GameObject.  Child Transforms are often static offsets from the center of the parent GameObject.  For example, we'll be adding rounded edges to the platform, which will require an X offset so that they are positioned next to the middle segment.

<hr></details>

## 2.3) Two Connected Platforms

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_2_Edges.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_3_Connected.zip)

Our level design calls for the bottom platform to rotate halfway through.  Create two Platform GameObjects and position and rotate their parent GameObjects so that they appear connected.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Use two copies of the Platform GameObject.
   - Select and copy / paste or right click and 'Duplicate'.
 - Position the parent GameObjects: 
   - Place both Platforms near the bottom of the screen, side by side. 
   - Raise the right Platform above the left.
 - Delete the rounded edges from both Platforms.
   - We don't need any edges here - in the middle they overlap, and the sides are off-screen.
 - Select the parent GameObject for the Platform on the right:
   - Use the rotate tool to modify the Transform's rotation Z value to about 4.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3s1bSBb.png" width=150px>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/40XUCJu.png" width=500px>



 - Use the move tool and with Vertex Snap (hold V):
   - Grab the bottom left anchor of the platform on the right and snap it to the platform on the left.

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/AKlw0IC.gif width=300px>

 - Zero the child sprite's position:
   - Select the child sprite from the Platform on the right.
   - Drag it out of the parent.

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/X8vQ6FD.png width=150px>

 - Copy the Transform component from the sprite you just dragged out.

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/QDhFcQ9.png width=300px>

 - Select the parent GameObject and paste the Component Values on the Transform.
 - Drag the sprite back onto the parent.

If done correctly, the child should now have a position and rotation of 0, but still appear rotated because of the parent Transform.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Why not use a single GameObject for this bottom platform?</summary>

We will be adding colliders to these platforms.  There are several ways this could be handled, as is always the case with GameDev. We will be placing BoxCollider2Ds on our Platforms' parent GameObjects.  This works great when the parent is a middle sprite segment along with a rounded corner sprite, but does not work as well when the platform changes its rotation halfway through.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why extend the platform beyond the edge of the screen?</summary>

The width of the world players are going to see is fixed, so you could argue that extending over the edge is not necessary.  However, I recommend this to ensure there are no unexpected gaps at the edge and to leave some flexibility for future mechanics, including:

 - Allow some enemies to continue off-screen and use the platform we can't see before returning to the game.
 - Screen shake.  This works by moving the camera up/down/left/right a bit.  Having the platforms extend beyond the edge of the screen allows us to do that without exposing gaps.

<hr></details>


## 2.4) Complete Platform Layout

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_3_Connected.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_4_Layout.zip)

At this point we have covered everything you need to match the level 1 platform layout.  You can match the layout we used or come up with your own.

<details><summary>How</summary>

The basic steps are:

 - Copy a parent Platform to start from.
 - Position and rotate the parent Platform.
   - The child sprites should have a position and rotation of 0, except for the edge sprites which may have an X position.
 - Modify the tile 'Width' for the middle segment sprite as needed.  
   - Platforms should extend off the screen a bit.
   - Use Vertex Snap to reposition the edge sprites.
   - If possible, use a width that's an even multiple of 1.28. Otherwise you may need to overlap the edge sprite to get the patterns to align.
 - Optionally, you can delete the rounded edges that are completely off-screen.

The project should look something like this, but don't worry about trying to match it perfectly; you can always adjust later:

## 2.5) Add Colliders 

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_4_Layout.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_5_Collider.zip)

Add a BoxCollider2D to each of the Platforms.  Add an edge radius and edit colliders to match the sprites.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Select all of the Platform parent GameObjects.
    - Add **BoxCollider2D** by clicking the 'Add Component' button in the Inspector, type BoxCollider2D and select it from the list.
      - Under the Box Collider 2D component, set:
         - Edge Radius: .1
         - Size Y: .44

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/8kGaZdk.png width=300px>


 - For each platform individually:
    - Click 'Edit Collider' and size to match the platform:
       - Click/drag the box which appears so that the outer green line encapsulates the platform.
      - Click and then hold Alt while adjusting the sides to pull both sides in evenly.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/us8Gyzz.gif" width=300px />

 - Repeat for each of the platforms.
   - For the bottom platforms which are two connected platforms - allow the colliders to overlap a little.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D5gBSiW.gif" width=300px />

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What is a Collider?</summary>

Colliders are components placed on GameObjects to define their shape for the purposes of physical collisions.  There are several shapes to choose from, here we are using a box.  

We use the edge radius on the box collider in order to smooth out the corners and better match the platform art.  off-screen, it doesn't matter if the end of the collider aligns with the sprite.

The collider shape may or may not align with the visuals on-screen.  Typically colliders match the shape of the art on-screen.  For example, they are used to keep the character from falling through the floor or walking through walls, and to cause the character to die when they hit an enemy.

Colliders may also be used as 'triggers' to detect something happening near an object without causing a physical reaction.  For example, an entity could have a second collider twice as large as the entity itself and use that to know when danger is approaching - causing the entity to run the other way.

More on [colliders from Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html).

<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why not place colliders on the child GameObjects instead?</summary>

Well, you could!  With GameDev, you'll find there are almost always various ways you could achieve a goal and pros/cons to each.  

Since we are using BoxCollider2D and an Edge radius, getting our sprites to connect with a smooth surface for entities to walk over would be more challenging when the colliders are on the child sprite GameObjects instead of the parent Platform.  

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QTjSEt7.png" width=50% />

Additionally, fewer colliders may improve your game's performance - however the difference here will not be noticeable.

For the bottom platforms, we overlap the colliders for a smooth experience when entities are walking from one to the next.

You could consider using PolygonCollider2D as well.

## 2.6) Reorganize Hierarchy

[YouTube]() | [Source before](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_5_Collider.zip) | [Source after](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/2_6_Organize.zip)

Organize GameObjects in the hierarchy and place the Platforms in a parent.

<details><summary>How</summary>

 - Reorder GameObjects so they appear in the same order as the game.
   - Click and drag to re-arrange the Platform GameObjects.
 - Rename each to represent it's position - e.g., "Level2".
 - Create an Empty GameObject:
   - Name it "Platforms".
   - Change the position to 0.
 - Select all of your existing Platform GameObjects:
    - Click and drag them onto "Platforms".

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What does the order in the Hierarchy impact?</summary>

Nothing.  

We are organizing just to help keep the project clean and easy to navigate.  There is no significance to the order GameObjects appear in the Hierarchy window.

Using a parent GameObject to hold the platforms does have some, although very little, overhead.  Additionally the position and rotation of that parent container if not zero will impact all the platforms.  It's still nice to do this - you can always remove the parent at the end of the project while working on optimizations.

<hr></details>

## To Review

<details><summary>Testing / debugging tips</summary>

   - Ensure the Transform for the child sprites and the parent 'Platforms' are at defaults (position 0, rotation 0, scale 1), except for the edge sprites which may have a X position.
   - When you open Unity, you may need to re-open the Level1 scene by double clicking Assets/Level1.
   - Sometimes Unity needs to be restarted.  If something is acting strangely or not working, you may want to close and reopen.
