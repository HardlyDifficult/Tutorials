## To Review, Level 2

https://github.com/hardlydifficult/2DUnityTutorial/archive/14_5_PlayAgain.zip

Create level 2 reusing a lot from level 1 but change various configurations such as having the cloud spawn HoverGuy enemies.  

The win condition for this level, to be added later, will be to jump over each of the breakaway platforms we add here.  

<details><summary>How</summary>

Create prefabs from Level 1 to reuse:

 - Open Level1 and create prefabs for:
   - Main Camera
   - Canvas
   - EventSystem
   - 1 Platform (any is fine, we will use this as a starting point in Level2).
   - 1 Ladder
   - EvilCloud
   - LevelController

<br>Start to design level 2 with prefabs from level 1:

 - Open Level2.
 - Delete the Main Camera.
 - Drag in the following prefabs:
   - Main Camera
   - Canvas
   - EventSystem
   - EvilCloud
   - LevelController
     - Level Number: 2
     - Select the Director
 - Add the Platform, Ladder, Hammer prefabs and any new art you would like to include.  
   - Copy / paste as needed to layout the level.
   - Note that it's okay to 'Break the prefab instance' while making changes.
   - Add a **Rigidbody2D** to each of the center platforms.
     - Freeze the Position and Rotation.
 - Add the Mushroom as well.  We are using **spritesheet_jumper_26**.
   - Add **PolygonCollider2D**.
   - Add **Rigidbody2D**:
     - Freeze the Position (X and Y) and Rotation.

<br>Add a section at the top where the Character cannot enter:

 - Add a Block at the top, we are using **spritesheet_ground_9**.
   - Add **Rigidbody2D**.
     - Freeze the Position and Rotation.
   - Add **BoxCollider2D**.
 - Create a layer 'CharacterOnly':
   - Disable CharacterOnly / Enemy and CharacterOnly / Feet collisions.
   - Assign it to all the blocks at the top and the mushroom.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/af8Jpj0.png" width=300px />

<br>Add the breakaway sections:

  - Add a Breakaway GameObject and sprite, we are using **spritesheet_jumper_69**.
    - Set to Layer **Floor**.
    - Add **TouchMeToWin**.
    - Add **PolygonCollider2D** for collisions.
    - Add **Rigidbody2D**.
    - Add **BoxCollider2D**, set it as a trigger and size it to capture the area above.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vttLU0g.png" width=300px />

<br>Configure the enemy:

 - Drag the HoverGuy prefab into the scene.
   - Rename it "HoverGuy2".
   - Remove the **FadeInThenEnable** component.
   - Enable the **WanderWalkController**:
     - Time Before First Wander: 0
   - Change the **RandomClimbController**
     - Odds of going up: .1
     - Odds of going down: .9
   - Create a new prefab for HoverGuy2 and delete the GameObject.
 - Select the EvilCloud and change the Thing To Spawn to HoverGuy2.

<br>Create the intro Timeline:

 - Select the EvilCloud's sprite GameObject and create a new animation  Animations/**CloudLevel2Entrance**.
   - Record any sequence you'd like.
   - Select Animations/CloudLevel2Entrance and disable looping.
 - Create a 'Timeline' file at Animations/**Level2Entrance**.
 - Select the EvilCloud's sprite GameObject and change the Playable Director's Playable to Level2Entrance.
 - Open the Timeline Editor window:
   - Add an Animation Track for the EvilCloud 
     - Add an Animation Clip for CloudLevel2Entrance.
     - Update the speed if needed.
   - Add Activation Tracks for the Hammers, Ladders, and LevelController.  
     - Time them to start near the end of the animation.
     - And end at the end of the timeline.
   - Then disable the Hammers, Ladders, and LevelController.

<br>Create the outro Timeline:

 - Create a new Scene named Scenes/**YouWin**:
   - Add it to Build Settings.
   - Return to Level2.
 - Create a new animation on the EvilCloud for the end of the game, named Animations/**CloudLevel2Exit**.
 - Create a new Timeline Animations/**Level2Exit** and select it in the Playable Director.
 - Open the Timeline Editor:
   - Create an **Animation Track** for the EvilCloud's CloudLevel2Exit clip.
     - Adjust the speed.
   - Add **TimelineEventPlayable**:
     - Position it to start about half way through the animation.
     - Change the Event Type to End.
   - Add **ChangeScenePlayable**:
      - Position it to start a few seconds after the TimelineEventPlayable began.
      - Change the Scene Name to "YouWin".
 - Select the LevelController and change the End of Level Playable to Level2Exit.
 - Switch the Playable Director back to Level2Entrance.

<details><summary>What does it mean to 'Break the prefab instance'?</summary>

This dialog sounds more serious than it is.  Breaking the prefab instance means that Unity will no longer tie this GameObject to a prefab - so if the prefab were to change the GameObject will not receive the update.  

The prefab itself is still in-tact and may be used for other objects or scenes.

<hr></details>
<details><summary>When freezing the rigidbody a warning appears, why do it this way?</summary>

When you freeze all constraints on the rigidbody, Unity presents a warning that this may not be an efficient way to achieve your goal of preventing the object from moving.  We have a bit of a unique use case for this case -- we will be removing these constraints once the end of the level is reached, allowing them to fall to the ground.

Alternatively you could have not included the rigidbody at all until the end of the level.  This is style preference, as well as a bit of a performance consideration as there is overhead to having a frozen rigidbody and there is overhead with adding a new component to a GameObject.

## Level 2 breakaway sequence

Once the character has touched each of the Breakaway platforms, make the level collapse.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Enable physics, causing the level to collapse:

 - Create script Components/Effects/**UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers : MonoBehaviour
{
  protected void OnEnable()
  {
    Rigidbody2D myBody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    myBody.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints2D.None;

    PlatformEffector2D effector 
      = GetComponent<PlatformEffector2D>();
    if(effector != null)
    {
      effector.enabled = false;
    }
  }
}
```

 - For each Block guarding the mushroom, each platform in the center (except the bottom platform), and the mushroom:
   - Add **UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers**.
     - Disable the component.
   - Add **EnableComponentsOnTimelineEvent**:
     - Event: End
     - Component list: UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers

<br>Breakaway blocks fall when touched:

 - For each breakaway block:
   - Add **UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers**.
   - Update TouchMeToWin to enable the Unfreeze component.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>What did that do?</summary>

Enable physics, causing the level to collapse:

The Timeline which plays when the level ends will enable UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers.  That component will then:

 - Remove all constraints on the rigidbody, allowing it to fall.
 - Disable the platform effector, if there is one.  This ensures there is no weird behaviour due to the one-way collisions from the platformer effect while the platform itself is falling and spinning.

<br>Breakaway blocks fall when touched:

When the player jumps over one of the breakaway blocks, UnfreezeAndDisablePlatformers is used to cause it to fall.

## GG screen

Design a scene to display when the player wins the game.  Here we drop a bunch of random "GG"s from the sky.

<details><summary>How</summary>

Configure scene:

 - Open the YouWin scene.
 - Configure the Camera color.
 - Add the GameController prefab.

<br>Create a GG object:

 - Create an Empty GameObject named "GG".
   - Add **TextMesh**:
     - Text: "GG"
     - Font Size: 36
     - Anchor: Middle Center
     - Alignment: Center
   - Add **BoxCollider2D**:
     - Size it tightly around the GG letters.
   - Add **Rigidbody2D**.
   - Add **SuicideIn** and set the time to 30.

<br>Randomize the GG:

 - Create script Components/Effects/**RandomGG**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class RandomGG : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  float minScale = .1f;

  [SerializeField]
  float maxScale = .7f;

  protected void OnEnable()
  {
    transform.localScale 
      = Vector3.one * UnityEngine.Random.Range(minScale, maxScale);

    TextMesh text = GetComponent<TextMesh>();
    text.color = UnityEngine.Random.ColorHSV();

    Bounds screenBounds = GameController.instance.screenBounds;
    transform.position = new Vector3(
      UnityEngine.Random.Range(screenBounds.min.x, screenBounds.max.x),
      screenBounds.max.y + 10,
      0);
  }
}
```

 - Add **RandomGG** to the GG GameObject.

<br>Keep the GG in bounds:

 - Create an Empty GameObject and add a **BoxCollider2D**
   - Size and position multiple to guard the screen edges.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KI8JXHK.png" width=300px />

<br>Spawn GGs:

- Create Prefabs/**GG** and delete the GameObject.
- Create an Empty GameObject named Spawner.
  - Add **Spawner** component
    - Initial wait time: 0
    - Min time: .1
    - Max time: 1
    - Thing to spawn: GG

<br>Press any key to return to the menu:

 - Create script Components/UI/**AnyKeyToLoadScene**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class AnyKeyToLoadScene : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField]
  string sceneName = "Menu";

  protected void Update()
  {
    if(Input.anyKeyDown)
    {
      SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneName);
    }
  }
}
```

 - Add **AnyKeyToLoadScene** to the Spawner.

<hr></details><br>
<details><summary>Explain the code</summary>



<hr></details>
<details><summary>Why a TextMesh instead of UI Text?</summary>

UI Text does not work with physics.  It's intended to be used on a Canvas and not have any interaction with objects in the world.  

Text Mesh can be added to a GameObject, allowing you to add a rigidbody for gravity and a collider to get them bouncing around.  Note that features built for the UI Text component, for example the Outline component, are not compatible with the Text Mesh.
